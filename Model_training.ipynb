Benefiting Michigan Your participation in Natural Gas Balance directly benefits our Michigan environment by helping to protect forests across the Upper Peninsula and by supporting the advancement of non-fossil fuels with renewable natural gas. The program uses carbon offsets produced from Michigan forests , including parcels near Pictured Rocks and in Marquette County. Natural Gas Balance also supports our commitment to renewable natural gas , which addresses greenhouse gas effects of methane by capturing methane gases from landfills and other waste facilities. Our Commitment We are taking bold steps to balance our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Our innovative DTE Gas Net Zero Plan involves DTE, its suppliers and customers and includes our DTE CleanVision commitment to provide a clean energy future for the communities we serve. DTE CleanVision is a family of programs, including Natural Gas Balance, that contribute to our ambitious climate action agenda. As we built our Gas Net Zero Plan, we wanted to offer our customers additional affordable and impactful options to balance their environmental footprint. CleanVision Natural Gas Balance is an exciting way for us to work together to create a cleaner environment for future generations. Evolving from an innovative customer participation program and informed by an extensive DTE customer survey , Natural Gas Balance gives you the opportunity to balance your environmental footprint using carbon offsets and renewable natural gas (RNG). Read more Read Less What are Carbon Offsets? Where do they come from? A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere, balancing your net carbon footprint. We have contracted with Anew , a leader in creative solutions for climate risk, to manage Michigan forest carbon offsets. All carbon offsets are being sourced from projects here in Michigan . DTE is working in partnership with industry developers to participate in Improved Forest Management (IFM) projects that promote sound forest management and enhance the health and resilience of Michigan\\\\'s trees. IFM project developers follow the methodology and protocol established by the nonprofit and independent American Carbon Registry . Sustained, healthy forests act as natural \\u201cscrubbers\\u201d that absorb and offset carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from burning natural gas. What is Renewable Natural Gas? How does DTE provide it? Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) is natural gas derived by capturing methane emitted from organic waste material in landfills, wastewater treatment plants and dairy farms. Methane gas is trapped and impurities are removed, creating a renewable source of pipeline quality gas . Using RNG prevents methane from being released into the atmosphere, significantly reducing the greenhouse gas environmental impact of methane. We purchase RNG from multiple producers, including the Sauk Trail Hills Landfill in Canton, Michigan, and wastewater treatment facilities in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and in Nebraska.

You can enter or leave at any time and you may change your level of participation once per month. During enrollment, you select one of four participation levels. The levels represent offsetting all or some percentage of natural gas usage in an average Michigan household. Please review the program\\u2019s Terms and Conditions . Measuring Progress Natural Gas Balance is approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). Our annual report highlights the number of Natural Gas Balance participants, our program supply details and the total emissions offset through participation. We use American Carbon Registry (ACR) methodology and protocol to quantify and report greenhouse gas emission benefits that result from our forestry projects. All offsets are registered with ACR . Potential Impact of Natural Gas Balance Once the program reaches our ten-year enrollment goal, participants will be protecting approximately 25,000 acres of Michigan forests and will have mitigated greenhouse gas emissions by one million metric tons of CO2-e . Environmental Impact and Participation Levels Natural gas usage emissions are expressed as carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, or CO2-e. That means the number of metric tons of CO2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of any other greenhouse gas. The average natural gas usage emission of a DTE residential customer household is 5.2 metric tons/CO2-e annually. The chart below shows the environmental impact in amount of CO2-e offset for each level of participation in the program. For comparison purposes, the offset is illustrated by the equivalent of removing a car from the road for one year. Participation Level Percent of Avg Household Use balanced Annual metric tons/CO2-e balanced Like taking off the road Monthly cost Level 1 25% 1.3 0.3 cars $4 Level 2 50% 2.6 0.6 cars $8 Level 3 75% 3.9 0.9 cars $12 Level 4 100% 5.2 1.1 cars $16 Annual metric tons of CO2-e offset (of an average Michigan home) was derived using the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator created by the Environmental Protection Agency.

All estimates are approximate. The Natural Gas Balance Story Natural Gas Balance evolved from our BioGreenGas (BGG) program that was ahead of its time when it launched in 2012 and gave our customers an opportunity to participate in RNG advancements. We conducted a survey of BGG participants and expanded it to all eligible customers about voluntary programs for a more sustainable future. Survey respondents chose among real life options on pricing and supply mix. Through analysis of survey results, we were able to understand what was truly important: our customers wanted a program in which they could affordably address up to 100% of their natural gas usage and include RNG in the supply. We used that feedback to develop Natural Gas Balance, which combines carbon offsets and RNG. More about Carbon Offsets and Renewable Natural Gas Am I addressing my home\\u2019s exact natural gas usage? No. The amount of emissions balance is based on natural gas usage of an average Michigan home . The average DTE residential customer\\u2019s annual gas usage is 95Mcf.* * Quantities of natural gas are usually measured in cubic feet (cf). The M in Mcf is the Roman numeral for 1,000. How does the program balance carbon offsets and RNG? Based on survey results from our customers (described above in The Natural Gas Balance Story ), we created a participation program that is impactful, affordable and includes carbon offsets and RNG. The program supports a cleaner Michigan with roughly 97% achieved through carbon offset and about 3% achieved with RNG . The majority of RNG produced today is sold into the transportation sector, and producers can take advantage of financial incentives specific to that sector. The 3% level allows us to acquire impactful amounts of RNG and completely pay the extra cost and full environmental attributes of RNG while keeping Natural Gas Balance affordable. How are my participation costs distributed? Your participation fees are used to cover the costs of offsets that help protect and preserve Michigan forests; to procure RNG , which helps to significantly balance the greenhouse gas impact of methane; and to help support program administration . Would going all-electric be more environmentally friendly? A shift to 100% electrification would present a tremendous challenge to our customers. In a colder climate like Michigan\\u2019s, natural gas is the most effective and efficient energy source for home heating and will remain so for the foreseeable future because of its low cost, abundance and reliability. Our number one goal continues to be to deliver safe, clean and affordable energy to our customers while protecting the environment through a diverse mix of energy options.

Environmental Policies Pollution Prevention Remediation Projects Coal Combustion Residual Rule Compliance Data and Information ELG Rule Compliance Data and Information Fuel Mix Toxics Release Inventory Reporting As one of Michigan\\u2019s largest employers and landowners, we understand the importance of leading by example. DTE Energy's waste reduction and recycling programs not only reduce or eliminate many types of waste, they also show our employees how they can put these sustainability ideas into practice at home. Reuse and Recycling Office Materials DTE Energy has maintained a paper and cardboard recycling program for decades. In recent years, we've expanded office materials recycling to include a wide variety of items including magazines, file folders and three ring binders. While recycling conserves renewable and nonrenewable resources, prevents pollution and is good for the environment, it's even better to use less from the start. We began a company-wide paper savings initiative in early 2009 resulting in a 19.6 percent reduction in copy paper purchased. As a result of this initiative, we expect our recycling rates to actually drop as we continue to use less paper. Our offices and facilities statewide collect and recycle alkaline batteries, computer equipment and light bulbs. The recent addition of plastic bottle recycling is very popular with employees. At 42 separate locations, nearly all our manned operations in the state, we recycle these common office materials. Every year in January, our employee Green Team collects thousands of holiday greeting cards and illustrated calendars. Handicapped students recycle the old cards into new cards, which we help them sell the following holiday season. The calendars go to a local nonprofit organization that works with children in school and at public events making art from recycled materials. Investment Recovery DTE Energy collects and sells millions of pounds of scrap metal each year, thanks to the efforts of our Investment Recovery organization. Breaking down and salvaging old materials is part of Investment Recovery's core mission. From telephones to transformers, this group finds new life for old materials, capturing reusable resources and contaminants that would otherwise be headed for landfills. For the past 68 years, DTE Energy and Goodwill Industries have worked together to provide the services traditionally offered through DTE Energy's Investment Recovery/Salvage operation. This includes the reclamation of surplus goods and equipment, and the liquidation of surplus, obsolete and scrap materials and equipment. As of January, this affiliation has produced a new partnership that will prove beneficial to both groups, including\\\\xa0Goodwill's Green Works'\\\\xa0new 96,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility at 6421 Lynch Road in Detroit. Through this partnership, Goodwill's workforce will be afforded new skills and training opportunities within the Greater Detroit area to increase future job prospects and promote individual growth. It also will allow DTE Energy to focus more on our core business while still maintaining oversight as to the disposition of materials and equipment, and significantly reduce our costs. Industrial Recycling DTE Energy also focuses on reuse and recycling from an industrial perspective. Examples of our efforts to embrace this commitment include: Finding a new use for the old bricks from the lining of the stack at our River Rouge Power Plant. The power plant replaced the lining of its stack and instead of disposing of 1.5 million pounds of bricks, we used them to create a new base for the plant's coal pile. This project prevented the brick from being sent to a landfill and offset the material resources that would otherwise have been used to create the base. Finding a new use for more than 220,000 pounds of rubber belting from our Monroe and Belle River Plants. Excess belting was reused rather than wasted in a landfill. Recycling more than 2.7 million pounds of old metal gas pipe. Our DTE Gas Natural Gas Transmission group installed new piping to improve reliability. Instead of leaving the old piping in place, we removed it and reused the material.

Release of fly ash into the air affects the environment and is strictly regulated\\\\xa0by clean air standards. In the 1920s, DTE Electric was the first utility to install\\\\xa0electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to collect fly ash (long before\\\\xa0any regulations were enacted). Since that time, fly ash has been used by concrete and asphalt\\\\xa0companies as a beneficial additive. Over the last few years, DTE Energy has improved the recyclability of our fly ash and increased recycle rates. Please see our Corporate Citizen Report to learn more about how we are successfully managing coal combustion byproducts. Deconstruction Activities DTE Energy is a leader in the field of \\u201cdeconstruction,\\u201d a process similar to demolition, except this innovative method focuses on reuse and recycling of materials within a building scheduled to be torn down or removed. This strategy considers the building materials as an asset. As the building is de-constructed, we harvest recyclable or reusable material. Our first deconstruction project in 2007 focused on a defunct DTE Energy office and warehouse space in New Hudson, Michigan. The deconstruction effort included all office furniture, building materials (mostly brick), fixtures, etc. Even the landscape vegetation was dug-up and relocated. An incredible 99.9% of the building materials were reused or recycled, 4,040,000 pounds. Because of its continued success, DTE Energy now routinely incorporates deconstruction into the demolition bidding process. PCB Waste Reduction PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were used\\\\xa0for decades by\\\\xa0electrical utilities as a fire retardant in the insulating oil used in electrical equipment. In the 1970s, concerns were raised about the safety of PCBs. DTE Electric ceased purchasing any new PCB-containing equipment in 1976, before the passage of a law defining this substance as \\u201ctoxic.\\u201d' We removed all PCB-containing equipment from public access areas in July of 1984, four years ahead of the federal deadline. Additionally, as part of EPA Region V's PCB Phasedown program, we removed from service the 13,000 PCB capacitors in DTE Electric substations by 2004. We continue phasing out equipment with oil that is classified as \\u201ccontaining\\u201d or \\u201ccontaminated\\u201d by PCBs. That equipment is converted to \\u201cnon-PCB\\u201d through retirement, retrofitting or replacement. In addition, DTE and many other utility companies have received approval from the EPA to dispose of PCB Remediation Waste with as-found PCB concentrations of less than 50 parts per million in certain non-Toxic Substances Control Act approved facilities, including municipal solid waste landfills. For more information on this approval or how it\\u2019s used at DTE sites, contact us at: DTE Energy Environmental Management and Safety Department, PCB SME One Energy Plaza Detroit, Michigan 48226. Green Fleet To bring you the reliable energy service you need, DTE Energy uses a number of work vehicles every day. To help protect the environment, we are continuously adding alternate fuel vehicles to our Fleet Operations. As a matter of fact, nearly 11% of DTE Energy vehicles are fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) or are electric or hybrid vehicles. Hybrids As we retire older vehicles used by DTE Energy supervisors, we are replacing many of them with Ford Escape Hybrids. These vehicles reduce our impact on the environment by lessening our reliance on gasoline and reducing CO2 emissions. Our field operations recently began using a hybrid lift bucket truck, which can operate for up to four hours without running the diesel engine. Using only the electric lift will result in significant reduction of noise and emissions in residential neighborhoods. Natural Gas Vehicles (NGVs) DTE Energy operates a large fleet of service vehicles across the state. These vehicles, which typically deliver low fuel-economy and really rack up the miles, gain the most from the switch to natural gas. Natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel, enabling our natural gas vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20\\u201329%. Natural gas vehicles not only create less greenhouse gases, fuel costs are lower, too. Those savings help us contain costs for you, our customers. We're also supporting the infrastructure development that's so important to these fleets. We operate 12 public NGV fueling stations and are adding more stations over the next several years. We\\u2019re also lending our expertise to support others as they open their own public or private fueling stations. Methane Reduction DTE Energy made an industry-leading commitment to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80 percent by 2050, largely by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from its coal-fired electric generation plants. We are now emerging as an industry leader in reducing emissions of another greenhouse gas \\u2013 methane \\u2013 by more than 80 percent by 2040. Learn how in our 2018 Methane Emissions Report . Additional Pollution Prevention At every level of our operation, we seek to minimize waste and find new opportunities for pollution prevention. We are also members of additional voluntary pollution programs, including the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality\\u2019s Michigan Business Pollution Prevention Partnership as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\u2019s Wastewise and\\\\xa0Natural Gas Star\\\\xa0programs. facebook DTE twitter DTE instagram DTE youtube DTE linkedin DTE Newsroom Police & Fire Future Investors Builders Landlord Large Commercial and Industrial Supply Chain Municipalities Careers Site Map Terms & Conditions Online Privacy Policy Customer Data Privacy Policy Contact Us \\u00a9\\\\xa02024 DTE Energy.

Environmental Policies Pollution Prevention Remediation Projects Coal Combustion Residual Rule Compliance Data and Information ELG Rule Compliance Data and Information Fuel Mix Toxics Release Inventory Reporting What is the TRI Report? The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a publicly available database of information on the release and transfer of nearly 650 chemicals by private companies and government facilities. Congress created TRI under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the program. Electric utilities were added to the list of manufacturing industries required to report to the TRI Program in May 1997. DTE Energy\\u2019s TRI Emissions DTE Energy uses a variety of fuels and energy sources to produce electricity. Five coal-fired power plants produce about 70 percent of the electricity that we supply, with the remainder produced by nuclear power, oil, natural gas, hydro and renewable energy , including wind and solar . Even with expert operation and sophisticated pollution control equipment, that much coal combustion produces millions of pounds of recycled by-products that are released into the air/water or disposed of in approved containment facilities. DTE obtains coal from dozens of mines and the coal from each mine has a unique mix of trace elements that are the source for chemicals reported in the TRI data. TRI emissions will vary both year-to-year and from plant-to-plant due to these factors. DTE\\u2019s overall TRI emissions have decreased. The graph below illustrates decreasing emissions since 2009. Click to View Based on available studies, DTE is confident its power plant releases are not harmful to employees or the public. DTE commits to operating its power generating stations in compliance with applicable regulatory standards. View the DTE Energy 2019 TRI Report. View the DTE Energy 2020 TRI Report.

The company undertakes several initiatives to reduce carbon footprint through rationalizing consumption, increasing the use of environment-friendly technology and responsibly sourced energy interventions are focused on four key areas: Establishment of city forests Bio-diversity restoration Water body rejuvenation Solar Energy integration Total Outlay : \\u20b9 264 lakh Number of Partners : 4 3 States : Sikkim, Maharashtra, Gujarat 6,49,000 sq ft Forest Cover 69,000+ Trees 10 City Forests 01 Bamboo Forest 01 Trees for Himalayan Bio-Diversity 01 Lake Restoration Under our Environmental Sustainability programme, we strive to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to reducing climate change impacts. We have set up multiple city forests and bio zones, using the Akira Miyawaki method based on the concept of \\u2018Potential Natural Vegetation\\u2019. The plants are carefully selected to form a self-sustaining bio-diversity. City forests produce oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide, and improve air quality. City Forests Establishment City or urban forests produce oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide and improve urban air quality. We have developed multiple city forests using the Akira Miyawaki method based on the concept of \\u2018potential natural vegetation\\u2019 and \\u2018native forest by native trees\\u2019. In this method, the main tree species are planted along with their companion species from the area\\u2019s natural vegetation. Since FY 2018-19, we have set up 27 city forests across multiple locations in and around Mumbai, Thane, Aurangabad, Nashik, and Jalna, Maharashtra, covering 1.2 lakh sq. ft. with 51,000 saplings belonging to as many as 150 native species. Trees for Himalayan Biodiversity at Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary Under our \\u2018Trees of Himalayan Biodiversity\\u2019 project, we planted 34,000 trees around the Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary in East Sikkim. This region in the Himalayas is rich in biodiversity which also offers rural community ways to earn a living. Large scale planting of trees provides employment to the community and offers a safe habitat for local flora and fauna. Bamboo Forest Under Project Green Gold, we planted a bamboo forest with 6,000 saplings spread across 14 acres, the hills of Balkapra Jawahar in the district of Palghar. Bamboo absorbs high levels of CO2, prevents soil depletion, reduces soil temperature, prevents water loss during monsoons, and raises the water bed of the surrounding area. The saplings will generate usable bamboo for 25 years, starting from the fifth year of planting. Under backward integration for the project, 450 vanvaasis have been trained in the bamboo craft. This forest will eventually help them source bamboo at an affordable price to make and sell products. We have also planted around 9,000 bamboo saplings under tree plantation drives during the last two years to act as a natural fence for the plantation. Spreading the Use of Cleaner Energy India is looking at reducing the consumption of fossil fuels by harnessing the sun\\u2019s power to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In line with the country\\u2019s vision, HDFC Life has set up a solar electrification project, \\u2018Schools on Solar\\u2019, at the B.A.F. Petit Girl\\u2019s High School, Mumbai and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Tribal Residential School, Shirole, Thane. Over the 25-year lifespan of this project, the total installation of 71.41 kWp across the two schools is likely to generate 99,974 units of electricity annually and 22,73,503 units cumulatively benefiting approximately 5,643 students and staff. The installations will help offset 1,819 MTCO2e of carbon emissions with savings of about \\u20b9.2.72 crore. The project also educates students and faculty on climate change and responsible energy consumption to save health and livelihoods....', 'ESG Churchgate Partners navbar Clear Clear --ESG World Framework-- ABRDN Alliance Bernstein Amundi Credit Suisse Federated Hermes Fidelity Forsyth Barr Franklin Templeton HSBC JP Morgan Jupiter Lazard Legal and General OMERS Royal London T Rowe Price Vanguard Bloomberg GEI Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) ESG Data Convergence Project (EDCP) EU Taxonomy Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) International Finance Corporation (IFC) International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Integrated International Reporting Framework (IIRF) National Institution for Transforming India Aayog (NITI Aayog) Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) World Economic Forum (WEF) World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) CRISIL Dun & Bradstreet EcoVadis FTSE Russell Glass Lewis ISS MSCI Refinitiv S&P CSA Sustainalytics Vigeo Eiris FIMI GRI 13 Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fishing GCCA Charter GCCA Conduct GRESB UNGC Sustainable Ocean World Steel Assoc.

The company undertakes several initiatives to reduce carbon footprint through rationalizing consumption, increasing the use of environment-friendly technology and responsibly sourced energy interventions are focused on four key areas: Establishment of city forests Bio-diversity restoration Water body rejuvenation Solar Energy integration Total Outlay : \\u20b9 264 lakh Number of Partners : 4 3 States : Sikkim, Maharashtra, Gujarat 6,49,000 sq ft Forest Cover 69,000+ Trees 10 City Forests 01 Bamboo Forest 01 Trees for Himalayan Bio-Diversity 01 Lake Restoration Under our Environmental Sustainability programme, we strive to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to reducing climate change impacts. We have set up multiple city forests and bio zones, using the Akira Miyawaki method based on the concept of \\u2018Potential Natural Vegetation\\u2019. The plants are carefully selected to form a self-sustaining bio-diversity. City forests produce oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide, and improve air quality. City Forests Establishment City or urban forests produce oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide and improve urban air quality. We have developed multiple city forests using the Akira Miyawaki method based on the concept of \\u2018potential natural vegetation\\u2019 and \\u2018native forest by native trees\\u2019. In this method, the main tree species are planted along with their companion species from the area\\u2019s natural vegetation. Since FY 2018-19, we have set up 27 city forests across multiple locations in and around Mumbai, Thane, Aurangabad, Nashik, and Jalna, Maharashtra, covering 1.2 lakh sq. ft. with 51,000 saplings belonging to as many as 150 native species. Trees for Himalayan Biodiversity at Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary Under our \\u2018Trees of Himalayan Biodiversity\\u2019 project, we planted 34,000 trees around the Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary in East Sikkim. This region in the Himalayas is rich in biodiversity which also offers rural community ways to earn a living. Large scale planting of trees provides employment to the community and offers a safe habitat for local flora and fauna. Bamboo Forest Under Project Green Gold, we planted a bamboo forest with 6,000 saplings spread across 14 acres, the hills of Balkapra Jawahar in the district of Palghar. Bamboo absorbs high levels of CO2, prevents soil depletion, reduces soil temperature, prevents water loss during monsoons, and raises the water bed of the surrounding area. The saplings will generate usable bamboo for 25 years, starting from the fifth year of planting. Under backward integration for the project, 450 vanvaasis have been trained in the bamboo craft. This forest will eventually help them source bamboo at an affordable price to make and sell products. We have also planted around 9,000 bamboo saplings under tree plantation drives during the last two years to act as a natural fence for the plantation.

The growth of the biogas sector in agriculture and rural development is significantly driven by its positive impact on health and gender equality. Modern biogas technology helps mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by capturing methane, a potent GHG, through the anaerobic digestion of organic materials like agricultural residues and organic waste. It can significantly uplift rural communities by creating economic opportunities and enhancing self-sufficiency. The implementation of biogas projects generates jobs in the construction and maintenance of biogas plants while allowing farmers to sell excess biofertiliser, diversifying their income streams. ET: What role does biogas technology play in promoting sustainable agriculture practices among farmers and how does it help them become climate resilient? PS: Modern biogas technology plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable agricultural practices among farmers while significantly enhancing their climate resilience. One of the primary benefits of biogas technology is its ability to replace traditional energy sources. By reducing reliance on firewood, farmers contribute to preserving forests, which are essential for maintaining biodiversity, preventing soil erosion, and acting as carbon sinks. This shift also helps cut down greenhouse gas emissions, making a substantial contribution to climate mitigation. Beyond clean energy, biogas plants produce biofertiliser, a nutrient-rich byproduct that enhances soil health, improves water retention and boosts crop yields. This natural fertiliser reduces the need for chemical alternatives, promoting more sustainable farming practices and helping farmers maintain productivity in the face of climate-related challenges such as erratic rainfall and soil degradation. Lastly, modern biogas technology addresses the harmful effects of livestock waste management. When cattle waste is left to decompose in the open, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas that is over 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its heat-trapping ability. This significantly contributes to global warming and air pollution. ET: What are the key challenges faced by small dairy farmers in adopting biogas technology? PS: One of the key challenges is the high upfront cost of installing biogas plants. For many, this is prohibitively expensive. Lack of technical expertise also often prevents farmers from efficiently operating and maintaining the biogas plants, leading to operational inefficiencies and, at times, plant failures. Another barrier is the scepticism many farmers have due to their experiences with traditional biogas plants, which were often inefficient and required substantial maintenance. These older systems often frustrated farmers. Additionally, traditional biogas plants required significant land space \\u2014 something small-scale farmers do not always have access to, further limiting adoption. Government initiatives and corporate partnerships can play a pivotal role in overcoming these barriers and scaling up the adoption of modern biogas technology. In India, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has implemented several programmes, such as the National Biogas Programme and the National Biogas and Manure Management Program (NBMMP), which provide financial assistance to small dairy farmers. ET: How can modern biogas technology contribute to India's national climate targets, such as the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development Goals , net zero by 2070, and the country\\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement (NDCs)? PS: As India strives to meet its ambitious climate targets, modern biogas technology is emerging as a promising solution offering a pathway to sustainable development while addressing pressing environmental challenges. With the government aiming for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, biogas plants present a viable solution for generating clean energy while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. This initiative aligns seamlessly with India\\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement, particularly in curbing methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. The widespread adoption of biogas plants among farmers is essential for reducing carbon emissions and directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action). By converting organic waste into clean energy, biogas plants not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also advance several interconnected SDGs. For example, biogas helps farmers save money on LPG cylinders and chemical fertilisers, allowing them to invest time and resources in other economic activities, contributing significantly to SDG 1 (\\u2018No Poverty\\u2019). Biofertiliser, which is produced as a byproduct during the biogas production process enhances agricultural productivity, supporting SDG 2 (\\u2018Zero Hunger\\u2019) and ensuring food security. By reducing reliance on traditional biomass fuels for cooking, biogas technology improves air quality, which promotes SDG 3 (\\u2018Good Health and Well-Being\\u2019). ET: In what ways does biogas technology support the promotion of a circular economy, and how does it help optimise waste management and resource utilisation in agriculture? PS: Modern biogas technology is a critical driver of the circular economy, offering innovative solutions for waste management and resource optimisation in agriculture. By utilising anaerobic digestion to convert organic waste into biogas and biofertilisers, biogas solutions effectively transform waste into resources. This process not only mitigates the environmental impact of waste disposal but also significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, which is a major contributor to climate change. Biofertiliser serves as a nutrient-rich organic fertiliser, enhancing soil fertility and promoting sustainable farming practices by decreasing reliance on chemical fertilisers by 70-80%. This dual benefit not only improves crop yields but also supports soil health. Lastly, biogas technology creates a sustainable energy source for cooking, heating, and electricity, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting energy security for farmers. ET: What are Sistema.bio\\u2019s plans? PS: Our ambitious goal is to manufacture and install over 1 million biogas plants by the end of 2030, focusing on the vast rural market while harnessing government and corporate support. Our advanced biogas technology not only facilitates sustainable energy production but also delivers significant environmental and economic benefits. By assisting corporations in reducing their residual carbon emissions, Sistema.bio is dedicated to contributing to India's net-zero goals while empowering farmers through clean energy solutions. This commitment underscores our resolve to drive the energy transition in India, align with national sustainability targets, and foster rural development. /article_liveblog.cms?msid=105115637&pos=botpotime:1 Nominations for ET MSME Awards are now open.

Save article as... \\u25be PDF XML Citation (BibTeX) View more stats Abstract Food waste is a global problem. When discarded into landfills through traditional municipal solid waste disposal, food waste is costly, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and highlights disparities of food insecurity. Government and retail campaigns overwhelmingly target consumers as responsible actors for tackling food waste through prevention, reduction, and recovery activities. Multinational enterprises (MNEs), however, play significant roles in contributing to global food waste and therefore must also face responsibility for contributing to sustainable solutions. The organizational management of food waste through recycling strategies confronts multiple United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) with economic, environmental, and social implications. Introduction We routinely waste one-third of the food we produce in this world. Annually, this waste costs $940 billion USD and represents 8% of greenhouse gas emissions; meanwhile, over 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , 2017; Hanson & Mitchell , 2017) . These statistics reveal significant economic, environmental, and social challenges. Most food waste is discarded through municipal solid waste streams into landfills, which is costly to transport and store, detrimental to the environment due to transportation carbon footprints and methane produced from landfills, and further marginalizes populations that incur the air, water, and ground contamination caused by this disposal method. Despite being the most common destination for food waste, landfills are the last place food waste should go based on widely accepted food waste hierarchies (Dubbeling , Bucatariu , Santini , Vogt , & Eisenbei\\u00df , 2016; US EPA , 2015) . These hierarchies first prioritize activities focusing on prevention and reduction, then recovery for human consumption, then recycling for non\\u2013human-consumption purposes, with landfilling as a last resort. Despite this tiered ranking, recycling food waste has the potential to divert larger volumes of waste away from landfills, create more jobs, and contribute greater economic value than prevention, reduction, and recovery activities combined (ReFED , 2016) , as shown in Table 1 . In many cases, food waste is unavoidable even with lean operation strategies, and issues of contamination, safety, and edibility complicate recovery efforts for donations to those in need. However, food waste has nutrients, calories, cellulose, etc. that are valuable for alternative applications. The land, water, fertilizer, and labor used to produce food must also be considered when measuring this waste product. When integrating these factors, the intrinsic value of this material reveals vast potential for untapped markets. Preventing, reducing, and recovering food waste are important and should remain high priorities, but recycling this resource is often skipped over completely, with food waste most commonly going directly to landfills before exploring recycling options. Recycling encompasses a variety of activities, such as repurposing for animal feed, compost for fertilizer and soil amendment, energy, and feedstock for manufacturing. When produced sustainably, food and its subsequent waste is a renewable, abundant, and constant resource. Recycling food waste offers market opportunities for a universal externality that remains largely underexplored in business research and underleveraged in business practice. The United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) encompass 17 goals and 169 targets, which are meant to provide blueprints to reach sustainable development advancements by 2030, an imminent deadline. These goals are expansive, which can result in paralysis of action. While an all-encompassing \\u201csilver bullet\\u201d solution is unrealistic, some actions combat multiple SDGs simultaneously for greater impact. Managing food waste through recycling strategies confronts several SDGs, including, but not limited to, Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12); Climate Action (SDG 13); Zero Hunger (SDG 2); Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11); Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Life on Land (SDG 15); Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3); and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17). Table 1. Annual estimations of economic, environmental, and societal impacts of food waste activities Activity category Diversion potential Volume in million tons Economic value USD in billions GHGs reduced In million tons of CO 2 Jobs created In thousands Prevention / Reduction 2.6 $7.7 9.7 \\u2013 Recovery 1.1 $2.4 3.4 4 Recycling 9.5 $121 4.8 11 Source of data: ReFED, 2016 Historically, governments and retailers facilitate food waste reduction campaigns that target consumers, but these efforts mainly focus on increasing awareness and educating consumers to nudge individual behavioral changes. While these campaigns are important, they are limited in scope because of their narrow concentration on consumer populations. Corporate managers have captive employee audiences and can leverage internal management and marketing strategies to influence employee behavior within their own organizational walls. Researchers and managers have much to gain from cooperative collaborations to develop knowledge to collectively solve problems (Bansal & Sharma , 2021) . We seek to bridge academia and industry by contributing two main insights. First, we describe the landscape of food waste in multinational enterprises (MNEs) to critically examine their role and responsibility to sustainable development. Second, we describe tangible, actionable strategies for MNEs to leverage food waste for economic, environmental, and social advancements to address multiple SDGs. We regularly assume that corporate changes surrounding SDGs require regulatory carrots (i.e., incentives) or sticks (i.e., mandates) through public policies. Utilizing waste as a resource is increasingly urgent for corporate, ecological, and societal survival and offers opportunities to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, create new markets, and create jobs without further degrading the planet. These contributions provide implications for managers and policymakers to direct more attention to MNEs to tackle SDGs through organizational food waste recycling. The Role and Responsibility of MNEs on Food Waste SDGs encourage and require involvement from multiple stakeholders, not least of which includes the private sector. Paradoxically, corporations receive inconsistent accountability for contributing to global problems and bearing responsibility for their solutions (Hahn , Kolk , & Winn , 2010) . Broadly defined, MNEs produce goods and/or deliver services in more than one country. MNEs are responsible for approximately one-third of global production, half of global exports, one-third of world GDP, and one-fourth of global employment (OECD , 2018) , thus demonstrating substantial contributions to international business and economic globalization. They also represent high concentrations of material and intellectual capital, resource sharing, and centralized management systems. These features enable MNEs to confront SDGs through their own organizational strategies, operations, and cultures. Since MNEs operate in various geographic regions with access to many individuals and resources, MNEs are uniquely positioned, compared to domestic firms, to tackle food waste with broader reach for greater global impact. Given the international scope, employment, resources, financial investments, and infrastructure of MNEs, they represent essential actors for global food waste initiatives. Industrial, organizational, and residential sectors represent 39%, 37%, and 24%, respectively, of estimated annual food waste generation (United States Environmental Protection Agency , 2020) . The residential sector receives disproportionate attention in research and policies despite being the smallest sector responsible for food waste generation. Global trends indicate that individuals frequently eat at their place of work (Lin et al. , 2017) , revealing opportunities for organizations to reflect on their own operations and strategies to tackle food waste. Undoubtedly, \\u201cthe role of MNEs is without dispute; not least because they have actively collaborated in the formulation of the SDGs themselves\\u201d (van Zanten & van Tulder , 2018: 25) . Therefore, the question of whether or not MNEs should play a role in achieving SDGs is not the proper framing. The more appropriate question is how should MNEs address SDGs? The SDGs are overwhelming for any single institution to grasp. Instead, SDGs require creative collaborations from public, private, and individual actors to tackle multiple issues simultaneously. Yet, corporate actors (e.g., MNEs) continue to receive unbalanced attention in their role and responsibility to participate in these collaborative solutions for global advancements (Hahn et al. , 2010) . Top-down approaches from government institutions have wide reach but are cumbersome and slow to execute. Bottom-up approaches from individuals are marginal in scale and difficult to coordinate. By focusing on agile lower order systems of individual employees and managers within organizations, MNEs can adopt strategies more quickly than through top-down or bottom-up approaches. MNEs have the ability, control, and responsibility to influence behaviors within their own organizational boundaries. Not all consumers of food are employees of MNEs, but all MNE employees consume food. MNEs can either be proactive leaders, stagnant bystanders, or reactive laggards in addressing SDGs, with consumers and investors increasingly monitoring these strategies. Proactive MNEs have first-to-market competitive advantages with heightened goodwill and reputational implications. Millennial and Gen Z workers expect their employers to actively engage in environmental and social issues, such as offering opportunities for employees to participate, which are trends that continue to grow. Inactive MNEs continue status quo operations despite a necessary shift to find alternatives to nonrenewable resources for feedstock and energy. Reactive MNEs wait until forced into regulated compliance and may incur financial fees, operational mandates, and/or brand abandonment in a world in which consumers and investors signal values through their purchases and economic activity. Strategies that can be implemented throughout a company with relatively little help from the government or civil society are easier for MNEs to execute given high levels of autonomy and control for self-regulation (van Zanten & van Tulder , 2018) . MNEs implement a variety of tactics when it comes to SDGs, ranging from launching their own initiatives to conforming to mandated regulations and norms. Food waste is a universal, inevitable, and renewable corporate externality that offers unique opportunities for MNEs to voluntarily lead in valorizing and commodifying this resource instead of discarding it. MNEs can, should, and must be leaders in global sustainable development, and one way to achieve this is through food waste recycling activities. Opportunities for MNE Food Waste Recycling food waste presents numerous actionable opportunities, some of which are outlined in Table 2 . This Table is not meant to be exhaustive or exclusive, but rather illustrates tangible activities that MNEs can implement to address multiple SDGs. These recycling activities can be incorporated into the waste management operations of any organization \\u2013 small or large, domestic or foreign \\u2013 through internal or external strategies. However, MNEs have flexibility to determine which activities best fit their industry, infrastructure, physical space, capital investment, volumes, etc. MNEs have unique reach and resources that position them well to be leaders in shifting operational norms for international business that promotes sustainable development. We describe these activities in further detail below. Table 2. Examples of outcomes of various food waste recycling activities for MNEs (neither exhaustive nor exclusive) Recycling activity Outcomes Economic 1 Environmental 2 Social 3 Animal feed Reduces costs for excess feed Reduces land, water, and carbon footprints from producing excess feed Promotes food security by feeding livestock for human consumption Compost Reduces fertilizer costs for landscaping Produces fertilizer,\\\\n        amends soil, sequesters carbon Promotes food security by growing food from compost Anaerobic digestion Reduces costs for nonrenewable energy Produces renewable energy, produces fertilizer Produces renewable energy,\\\\npromotes food security by growing food\\\\nfrom compost Feedstock for manufacturing Reduces supply chain vulnerabilities / dependencies Produces renewable\\\\nnon-virgin feedstock material Stimulates innovation for creative products Biofuel Reduces costs for nonrenewable energy Produces renewable energy Produces biosoap for improved health\\\\nand well-being 1 Recycling activities reduce varying amounts of economic cost savings (e.g., landfill tipping fees, fuel costs) as well as value added products that can be sold for positive returns on investment 2 Recycling activities reduce varying amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., CO 2 from transportation, methane from landfills) 3 Recycling activities create varying numbers of jobs, both internal and external, through logistics and management of food waste (e.g., creating and operating gardens to grow food for employees, managers, and community members) Recycling food waste for animal feed is a practical strategy in rural areas when MNEs have proximity to livestock operations and facilities that process pet food. A growing global tactic involves using insects (e.g., black soldier fly larvae, cockroaches) to process food waste. Not only do insects naturally and rapidly consume food waste, but they can also then be utilized for human consumption, as more animal feed, in medicinal applications, for compost, or converted into energy. Composting transforms food waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer and soil amendments by combining it with other organic materials (e.g., dried leaves, yard waste), heat, water, aeration, and time. Composting systems range from small indoor bins (e.g., vermicomposting) to large-scale industrial operations (e.g., aerated static piles, windrow) and vary in terms of physical size, processing capacity, and time frames to reach a finished product. Anaerobic digestion employs microorganisms that break down food waste in the absence of oxygen to produce methane in a controlled procedure to harness energy (e.g., biogas, electricity, heat). Combining food waste with other types of waste (e.g., animal manure, wastewater biosolids) may result in higher yields of energy depending on the capabilities of the digestor. This process also produces nutrient-rich fertilizer as a byproduct. The disparities between food waste and hungry people highlights problems of logistics, not production capacity. Producing food in food deserts that have less resources, land, equipment, and funding are necessary to increase access to food. Compost can be used in plot gardening and vertical farming to increase food security in urban settings with limited physical space. Feeding food waste to insects to then be used as fish feed in aquaponics systems offers another non-traditional agricultural technique for producing food in situations with spatial constraints. Community gardens frequently rely on support from nonprofits, government grants, and community volunteers. MNEs facilitate infrastructures (e.g., buildings, roads) and employ workers located in food deserts around the world. Sometimes employees cannot afford healthy food or do not have easy access to it while juggling work, transit, and family schedules. By recycling food waste and creating corporate / community gardens, MNEs can activate their role and responsibility to contribute to increasing food security and well-being for their employees and their communities. Commodifying food waste into feedstock for manufacturing upcycles this material into new products of higher value. A firm in Italy recycles orange peels into fiber for fabric. A German firm compresses coffee grounds with plant fibers, beechwood grains, and natural resins to create biodegradable coffee cups. A firm in Micronesia converts banana leaves into wallets and business cards. Combining crab shells with tree fibers may one day replace flexible plastic packaging. Food waste in the form of fats, oils, and grease are converted into biodiesel, generating a source for renewable energy. This process also yields useful byproducts (e.g., soap) offering an alternative to palm oil, which contributes substantially to deforestation and climate change. One way MNEs can recycle food waste is to outsource activities (external action) by selling their food waste to other firms to process. Alternatively, MNEs can vertically integrate food waste recycling (internal action) into their own operations. Both strategies promote circular design to reincorporate waste back into economies instead of linearly discarding it. Outsourcing these activities creates more external jobs but likely requires more shipment of this material, which is not without consequences. Vertically integrating these activities creates more internal jobs with tighter systems of circularity. Regardless of the strategy, efficient resource utilization of food waste has significant potential to reduce costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and the marginalization of food insecure populations. Empirical research on food waste recycling activities in MNE contexts would provide valuable developments to quantify and qualify which activities have the greatest impact on various economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Some MNEs have employee programs that incentivize or mandate employee involvement in SDG initiatives, such as spending one hour per month on sustainable development projects (e.g., distributing educational materials, designing training content, building houses). Food waste recycling offers tangible opportunities for managers and employees of MNEs to directly tackle several SDGs. Considerable differences (e.g., costs, technical expertise, infrastructure, physical space) between these activities present limitations based on the specific MNE. The optimal solution will vary depending on an MNE\\u2019s capabilities and desired outcomes. MNEs should be mindful to apply customized strategies for countries with different cultural norms, regulatory restrictions, and geographic constraints the same way they conduct market segmentation. Combining activities and trying creative innovations may maximize opportunities for resource efficiencies and new markets. Future research that explores how and why MNEs manage food waste would provide important contributions to identify and understand the drivers and barriers of these activities for sustainable development in international business. Conclusion MNEs can, should, and must be leaders in global sustainable development. One way they can tackle multiple SDGs simultaneously is by treating food waste as a valuable resource. Whether this resource is sold as a commodity or processed through in-house operations, recycling food waste offers opportunities for economic, environmental, and social advancements. By utilizing the full potential of food waste from a managerial perspective, MNEs can reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, negative impacts on the environment, and food insecurity for their employees and communities. From a policymaker standpoint, positioning public policies to support MNE leadership for sustainable development stimulates public-private collaborations (SDG 17). These public-private collaborations could manifest as policies that support MNE activities through subsidies for diverting food waste away from landfills through circular activities and through employee-community garden partnerships to reduce food deserts and insecurity. Business research surrounding food waste pays limited attention to MNE contexts despite significant opportunities for theoretical development on profitable strategies that concurrently benefit the environment and society. We offer insights that encourage managers and policymakers to leverage food waste in a time when resource depletion, climate change, and social disparities threaten international business indiscriminately. We contribute a variety of specific, actionable activities for MNE managers and policymakers to confront SDGs by managing organizational food waste efficiently. These insights also highlight important areas for growth in research and education to bridge academia and industry for relevant theoretical and practical developments. MNEs play a critical role in driving firm-level innovations to address multiple SDGs through food waste recycling and must be held accountable to realize their leadership for sustainable development.

Stock photo. .post-thumbnail Overview: -A Michigan Public Service Commission audit finds DTE Energy and Consumers rank poorly on the frequency and duration of outages. -The report notes that both utilities have failed to meet their tree-trimming goals and that some infrastructure is over a century old. -DTE is already using the audit to push for its proposed $456.4 million rate increase, which it says is necessary to modernize the grid and improve reliability. An audit released this week found that DTE Energy and Consumers Energy ranked poorly for the frequency and duration of power outages. Both companies underinvested in tree trimming, and their critical infrastructure has deteriorated. The Michigan Public Service Commission ordered the audit following the February 2023 ice storm that left more than 700,000 Michiganders without power, with some residents unable to heat their homes for days. The audit backs up ratepayer advocates who have said for years that DTE and Consumers fail to keep up with tree trimming while the companies focus on capital investments that automatically earn their shareholders a return on equity. However, the audit\\u2019s finding that grid infrastructure is often outdated could help utilities push for further rate hikes. Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, told Planet Detroit that the audit supports CUB\\u2019s position that DTE and Consumers need more basic maintenance to reduce outages. She said big utilities focus too much on costly capital projects while overlooking cost-effective solutions like more frequent tree trimming. \\u201cBig utilities are\\u2026proposing capital expenditures that cost ratepayers a ton while delivering questionable benefits for reliability,\\u201d she said. MPSC Chair Dan Scripps said in a statement that the audit, conducted by Liberty Consulting Group, an independent firm based in Pennsylvania, was the first of its kind in Michigan. \\u201cThe audit underscores that now is the time for both companies to focus more on strategic investments to prevent outages rather than reacting to them,\\u201d Scripps said. Mark Brewer, an attorney and former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, was unconvinced the audit would change much, suggesting utilities\\u2019 political spending could help them dodge accountability. \\u201cPrediction: despite deplorable service and excessive rates DTE Electric and Consumers Energy will lobby and buy their way out of accountability like they have for decades,\\u201d he wrote on X. Last year, Michigan legislators passed nation-leading clean energy legislation with few consumer protections, an oversight that State Rep. Abraham Aiyash (D-Hamtramck) said was due to utility influence. He said utilities were \\u201cthe elephant in the room\\u201d during negotiations over the bill package and that legislators understood that utilities \\u201chave to at least be neutral on the passage of bills in order to move them across the finish line.\\u201d DTE and Consumers didn\\u2019t directly respond to concerns about their political spending. DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said, \\u201cDTE remains committed to improving reliability for our customers.\\u201d Consumers spokesperson Brian Wheeler said, \\u201cConsumers Energy will continue to advocate to build a smarter and stronger power grid that serves Michigan reliably 24/7.\\u201d DTE and Consumers fail to trim trees as reliability suffers The audit found that both DTE and Consumers failed to meet their tree trimming goals, which increases grid vulnerability as trees hitting power lines is a major cause of outages. DTE aims to trim trees on a five-year cycle, while Consumers aims for a five- to nine-year cycle. But in practice, DTE trims trees on a five- to seven-year cycle, and Consumers has a trimming backlog that means it\\u2019s on a 10-year cycle.

Following the ice storm in 2023, critics noted that the publicly-owned Lansing Board of Water and Light experienced only a handful of outages . Lansing received significant ice during the storm, albeit not as much as southeast Michigan. LBWL had stepped up its tree trimming program after the 2013 ice storm, which led to extensive outages. Advocates have argued that DTE deprioritizes tree trimming because utilities can only recoup the maintenance cost from ratepayers. Instead, the cost of new equipment like transformers or power polescan be added to the company\\u2019s rate base, earning its rate of return on investment, including 50% equity for stockholders. Shareholders include DTE executives, who receive millions in stock options . The audit found that in 2022 and 2023, both DTE and Consumers were in the bottom 25% of utilities for Customer Average Interruption Data Index (CAIDI), a measure of the time it takes to restore power. More than 13% of DTE\\u2019s customers experienced four or more power outages in 2023 and 45% dealt with an outage lasting more than eight hours. Over 10% of Consumers\\u2019 customers experienced four or more outages and 25% lost power for over eight hours. Aging infrastructure could mean further rate hikes for Michigan customers Significant portions of DTE and Consumers\\u2019 infrastructure are over a half-century old, with some equipment exceeding the century mark, according to the audit. Around 40% of DTE\\u2019s substation transformers were installed before 1960 and some were put in place in 1924. The report also found that the company doesn\\u2019t track the age of its service transformers. Roughly 40% of DTE\\u2019s circuit breakers and reclosers date from between 1930 and 1960. The report said that DTE\\u2019s transformers were older than comparable utilities, but this wasn\\u2019t the only factor that needed consideration. \\u201cWhile condition rather than age should drive transformer replacement, periodic excessive loadings contribute to high DTE\\u2019s substation transformer failure rates,\\u201d the report said. The audit found Consumers also had aging infrastructure. Around 45% of its substations were installed between 1903 and 1960, with a large number built in the 1950s. DTE responded to the audit with a statement saying the company was \\u201claser-focused on delivering on our commitment to our customers\\u2013reducing power outages by 30% and cutting outage time in half by 2029.\\u201d The company said it would invest in both infrastructure and tree trimming, including \\u201csmart grid\\u201d technologies that allow system operators to evaluate problems. Wheeler, with Consumers, said the company was adding technology, burying power lines and trimming trees to improve reliability in the face of more frequent storms. \\u201cMichiganders are facing more severe and frequent storms, which is why we announced our Reliability Roadmap in 2023, a blueprint for fewer and shorter outages, including no customer going more than 24 hours without power,\\u201d he said. DTE is already using the audit to argue for its proposed $456.4 million rate increase , which it says is necessary to modernize the grid and improve reliability. In emails related to the rate case , DTE executives emphasized the audit\\u2019s focus on pole top maintenance and modernization, capital investments that Bandyk said could be paid by customers while creating profits for DTE shareholders. However, at last week\\u2019s hearing on the proposed rate hike, many Detroiters questioned why service had yet to improve with previous rate increases , saying ratepayers were already making difficult choices between paying for things like food and medicine and their utility bills. \\u201cDTE and Consumers Energy need to get (tree trimming) in order before regulators should even consider the massive increases in rates that both have requested,\\u201d Bandyk said.

Three years ago, most employers had to close their office doors and figure out how to manage their employees' personal and professional needs remotely. Today, many employers are still operating in hybrid or remote models and are relying on healthcare analytics tools to keep a pulse on their population health from afar. Fortunately, organizations like DTE Energy have been managing large, diverse, and \\u201cdeskless\\u201d employees for decades and have plenty of best practices to share. We recently had the privilege of presenting at the Business Group on Health Annual Conference with DTE. The focus of the session was on leveraging data to achieve a culture of health (CoH) and wellbeing for your employees and dependent populations. Build a Culture of Health DTE is a best-in-class example of keeping employee health and wellness as the top priority and for instilling a true Culture of Health . While it\\u2019s known that healthy employees do directly impact business health, companies that embrace a CoH believe in implementing these wellbeing programs simply because it's the right thing to do. DTE shared that infusing wellbeing into their culture has always been extremely important to senior leadership and that executives have made a conscious effort to lead by example and openly prioritize their own health and wellness to inspire others. That initial buy-in and transparency from leadership sparked an organization-wide movement and has continued to grow and flourish for over five years. So, what was their secret to success? The answers were right in front of them, buried in their employee health data. \\u201cYour health is what I worry about the most, because without you we are nothing.\\u201d \\u2013 Jerry Norcia, Chairman and CEO, DTE Energy Build a blueprint with data The DTE team understands that a data-driven approach is crucial to create a best-in-class CoH. They curated a robust data warehouse and worked with the Merative\\u2122 Health Insights team to build a custom dashboard system to synthesize that data to obtain insights that drive action. DTE walked us through the five-year evolution and shared best practices and lessons learned, here were the top takeaways and how DTE solved for them: Divider Prioritize with purpose Start by establishing top goals and how you plan to measure against them. DTE had established five leading and lagging indicators to help measure things like maturity levels, effectiveness, efficiency, and status. DTE also conducted a gap analysis to identify where there is opportunity for improvement and identified different programs and tactics to solve those problems. Sequence matters It\\u2019s impossible to do everything at once. Create an action plan and start with the low hanging fruit. For years, DTE moved with intention and strategy as they gradually grew different programs and tactics, backed by data. The team continuously used data to guide decisions and next steps to ensure they were providing value to employees and their families. Cast a big net We live in a world that relies on data, and it can be overwhelming to process all the different sources and formats. As you establish a stronger data and analytics foundation, you unlock a whole new world of insights. DTE Energy has found a lot of value in working with numerous data types because they gain a fuller picture of their population health, helping identify gaps to provide more meaningful benefits for employees. Divider Conclusion The Health and Wellbeing team at DTE Energy is proud of the progress they\\u2019ve made and will continue to rely on employer analytics to support decision-making. When reflecting on the last five years, the team credits much of their success to leadership\\u2019s influence and unwavering support, competitions and communications to drive engagement, and identifying metrics and actionable goals ahead of time to move with strategy and intention. We look forward to continuing helping organizations like DTE Energy use data to direct, determine, and drive results. \\u201cMetrics are vital to our effort; they help us engage stakeholders, create and sustain momentum, assess needs and encourage action.

The company also reported third quarter earnings of $477 million or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $332 million, or $1.61 per diluted share in 2023. Operating earnings for the third quarter 2024 were $460 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, compared with 2023 operating earnings of $298 million, or $1.44 per diluted share. Operating earnings exclude non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported earnings to operating earnings are included at the end of this news release. \\u201cThrough their innovation and hard work, DTE team members are making great progress building a cleaner, more resilient energy grid to keep the power flowing for our customers,\\u201d said Jerry Norcia, DTE Energy chairman and CEO. \\u201cIn the third quarter of 2024 alone, we started construction of three new solar energy parks. We are also building or energizing 10 new substations to power Michigan\\u2019s future. Our solid financial strength and constructive regulatory environment allow us to continue to invest above our generated cash flows for improved reliability and cleaner generation.\\u201d Norcia noted the following accomplishments in the third quarter: Continued on path to improving electric reliability through investments in smart grid technology and new substations. DTE\\u2019s investment in smart grid technology prevented more than 9,000 power interruptions and more than 3.6 million minutes without power for customers so far in 2024. Smart grid technology automatically detects and de-energizes downed wires, which improves people\\u2019s safety, and helps isolate areas of damage, reroute power for many customers and quickly pinpoint the damage location, which shortens outage time and speeds up restoration. The company is also at various stages of constructing or energizing 10 new substations across its service territory. Substations, also equipped with smart grid technology, are critical parts of the electric grid that adjust voltage levels coming from power plants to distribute electricity safely and efficiently to homes and businesses. Began construction of three new solar parks, all funded by company\\u2019s voluntary MIGreenPower program: As Michigan\\u2019s largest producer of and investor in renewable energy, DTE broke ground on three new solar parks in response to growing customer support for clean, renewable energy. The Fish Creek and Mission Road solar parks in mid-Michigan, and the Little Trout solar park in northern Michigan, are all funded by customers who voluntarily enrolled in DTE\\u2019s industry-leading CleanVision MIGreenPower program . These solar developments are another step toward the company\\u2019s goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions and bringing the State of Michigan significantly closer to its clean energy goal of 60% by 2035. Installed nearly 1,000 free air conditioners for people in need in metro Detroit: As summer temperatures rose, DTE\\u2019s Energy Efficiency Assistance (EEA) team delivered free AC units and made home repairs for local income-qualified customers as part of an ongoing effort to support vulnerable populations. As a part of the initiative, customers may also receive additional assistance including weatherization, new appliances and insulation to ensure their homes meet health and safety standards. Published 2023 CleanVision Sustainability Report : DTE shared its progress in executing its sustainability strategy to improve operations, accomplish net zero goals, care for customers \\u2013 especially the most vulnerable \\u2013 and develop a workforce to lead Michigan\\u2019s energy future in its 2023 CleanVision Sustainability Report . Recognized for initiatives in making DTE a great place to work: For the second consecutive year, The Health Project recognized DTE\\u2019s use of evidence-based programs for employee wellness to achieve meaningful results. More than 85% of DTE employees participate in the company\\u2019s programs, which improve their lives by reducing critical lifestyle-related health conditions and workplace injuries. Disability:In, the leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide, named DTE one of the Best Companies for Disability Inclusion, awarding the company with a top score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index for creating an accessible and inclusive environment where all employees can feel a sense of belonging and thrive. DTE\\u2019s employee resource group for veterans and their allies received the 2024 Michigan Veteran Affairs Agency Employer Innovator Award for its proactive recruitment and onboarding programs and for collaborating with other organizations to improve veterans\\u2019 lives. Outlook for 2024 DTE Energy confirms 2024 operating EPS guidance of $6.54 - $6.83. \\u201cWe are confident that we will achieve our financial targets in 2024 while making significant strides in our infrastructure investment plan to improve how we produce and deliver energy for our customers and communities,\\u201d said David Ruud, DTE executive vice president and CFO.

In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2024 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company\\\\'s 2024 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2024 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items (i.e. future non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations). These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings. The information contained herein is as of the date of this document. DTE Energy expressly disclaims any current intention to update any information contained in this document as a result of new information or future events or developments. Certain information presented herein includes \\\"forward-looking statements\\\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and businesses of DTE Energy.

The ongoing boom in the online markets has directly impacted our commercial activities and in a country like India, where the fruits of development are poised to emerge heavily in the near future, this impact has been profound. Indian economy is set to emerge as a global giant in the coming times and the mass outreach of digital technology coupled with the thrust of the incumbent administration is fuelling this trend. Earlier, during the pre-disinvestment era, the core sectors of economy, like the banking, insurance and allied industries were noted for the bulky amounts of paperwork, administrative hassles, and extensive mechanisms of operations. This was especially true for the insurance sector. However, after the early 2000s, when the private insurance players were introduced, things began to change effectively and with the advent of digital technology and the benefits that come with it, not only has the routine information and data gathering become a less time consuming and simple process, but it has also become more reliable and the incidence of human error has become almost nil. This has had a very beneficial impact on the core business development and consumer-centric approach has attained new levels of growth. Today, comparing insurance policies offered by different insurers involved days of meetings with advisors, extensive paperwork, elaborate documentation and multiple rounds to the offices of insurance companies. Intensive paperwork and manual handling of data also meant that there was a high probability of human error and concurrent mistakes. In such cases, the customer had to begin the process again, which resulted in wastage of time and efforts. However, today, the online mode has taken over the offline mode and this has impacted every routine procedure. The process of purchasing a plan is now just a click away and has been thoroughly simplified. However, at the same time, online procedures mean disclosing important pieces of information online and this has also increased the vulnerability to various unwanted and ill practices. Online linkage between personal data and vital records like account details, bank information etc. has increased the instances of online scams and data theft. There have been multiple instances wherein unsuspecting individuals have been duped by online scammers who use e-mails as a tool for gathering the crucial personal information through phishing scams. The advent of social media tools has further increased this menace and people of all age groups today are vulnerable to such malpractices. What is therefore required is to adopt a careful and proactively vigilant attitude while being online. Sensitive or personal information must never be shared online or on social media groups.\\\\xa0 In today\\\\'s world, where data means everything, we must remain cautious and must avoid replying in any manner to any fraudulent emails or messages. In case of any such concern, we must always seek the help of governmental cyber-patrolling and IT cells. Along with the protection of data and personal information, financial security is equally crucial.

The company undertakes several initiatives to reduce carbon footprint through rationalizing consumption, increasing the use of environment-friendly technology and responsibly sourced energy interventions are focused on four key areas: Establishment of city forests Bio-diversity restoration Water body rejuvenation Solar Energy integration Total Outlay : \\u20b9 264 lakh Number of Partners : 4 3 States : Sikkim, Maharashtra, Gujarat 6,49,000 sq ft Forest Cover 69,000+ Trees 10 City Forests 01 Bamboo Forest 01 Trees for Himalayan Bio-Diversity 01 Lake Restoration Under our Environmental Sustainability programme, we strive to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to reducing climate change impacts. We have set up multiple city forests and bio zones, using the Akira Miyawaki method based on the concept of \\u2018Potential Natural Vegetation\\u2019. The plants are carefully selected to form a self-sustaining bio-diversity. City forests produce oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide, and improve air quality. City Forests Establishment City or urban forests produce oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide and improve urban air quality. We have developed multiple city forests using the Akira Miyawaki method based on the concept of \\u2018potential natural vegetation\\u2019 and \\u2018native forest by native trees\\u2019. In this method, the main tree species are planted along with their companion species from the area\\u2019s natural vegetation. Since FY 2018-19, we have set up 27 city forests across multiple locations in and around Mumbai, Thane, Aurangabad, Nashik, and Jalna, Maharashtra, covering 1.2 lakh sq. ft. with 51,000 saplings belonging to as many as 150 native species. Trees for Himalayan Biodiversity at Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary Under our \\u2018Trees of Himalayan Biodiversity\\u2019 project, we planted 34,000 trees around the Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary in East Sikkim. This region in the Himalayas is rich in biodiversity which also offers rural community ways to earn a living. Large scale planting of trees provides employment to the community and offers a safe habitat for local flora and fauna. Bamboo Forest Under Project Green Gold, we planted a bamboo forest with 6,000 saplings spread across 14 acres, the hills of Balkapra Jawahar in the district of Palghar. Bamboo absorbs high levels of CO2, prevents soil depletion, reduces soil temperature, prevents water loss during monsoons, and raises the water bed of the surrounding area. The saplings will generate usable bamboo for 25 years, starting from the fifth year of planting. Under backward integration for the project, 450 vanvaasis have been trained in the bamboo craft. This forest will eventually help them source bamboo at an affordable price to make and sell products. We have also planted around 9,000 bamboo saplings under tree plantation drives during the last two years to act as a natural fence for the plantation. Spreading the Use of Cleaner Energy India is looking at reducing the consumption of fossil fuels by harnessing the sun\\u2019s power to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In line with the country\\u2019s vision, HDFC Life has set up a solar electrification project, \\u2018Schools on Solar\\u2019, at the B.A.F. Petit Girl\\u2019s High School, Mumbai and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Tribal Residential School, Shirole, Thane. Over the 25-year lifespan of this project, the total installation of 71.41 kWp across the two schools is likely to generate 99,974 units of electricity annually and 22,73,503 units cumulatively benefiting approximately 5,643 students and staff. The installations will help offset 1,819 MTCO2e of carbon emissions with savings of about \\u20b9.2.72 crore. The project also educates students and faculty on climate change and responsible energy consumption to save health and livelihoods....', 'privacy-policy Google Tag Manager (noscript) End Google Tag

Image: John and Penny/Shutterstock googleon: all AIB says viewing social media accounts helps it understand customer behaviour. The national civil society group campaigning for a Yes vote in the upcoming Irish referendum on the Eighth Amendment fell victim to a cyberattack last week. DDoS attacks meant the Together For Yes fundraising page as well as Amnesty International\\u2019s went down for a period of a half hour and 45 minutes, respectively. The DDoS attacks originated in Ireland. Also last week, Ryanair made a major move with its infrastructure as it announced it would be closing the majority of its data centres over the next three years. The airline, which carries 130m passengers annually, will be going all in with AWS in terms of its IT system. Ryanair CTO John Hurley said: \\u201cBy rebuilding core applications, converting data into actionable insights and creating intelligent applications, we are putting the solutions in place to continue our leadership in the travel industry.\\u201d Meanwhile, MacOS users of the popular encrypted messaging service Signal were last week advised to disable app notifications for privacy reasons. Researcher Alec Muffett found that so-called \\u2018disappearing messages\\u2019 were showing up as notifications. Patrick Wardle, a Mac security expert, found the data was still being stored inside the OS \\u2013 but there\\u2019s a simple fix . Moving on to this week, from AIB\\u2019s social media spying to a major email security problem, catch up on your enterprise news here. Is AIB watching you? The AIB group has been accused of spying on customer social media accounts, according to a report in The Irish Independent . The lender is apparently combing through Twitter, Facebook and other social media accounts for comments about its service. Customers are now required to sign a consent form, which gives permission for tasks such as credit checks to be carried out, as well as allowing the bank to look at social media profiles. Mortgage broker Karl Deeter said: \\u201cI\\u2019m confident that people would not be comfortable knowing that the bank can play Big Brother with their social media information.\\u201d A spokesperson said it was in line with common practice, dubbing it \\u201cregular social listening\\u201d and adding that it never analyses the individual accounts of customers. PGP encryption is seriously vulnerable Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a method of data encryption often added to programs involved in the sending and receiving of email messages. German newspaper S\\u00fcddeutsche\\\\xa0Zeitung released details of the vulnerability prior to an embargo, and the EFF had advised immediately disabling email tools that automatically decrypted PGP. Sebastian Schinzel of the Munster University of Applied Sciences had been examining the problem. The issue concerned email programs that failed to properly look for decryption errors before following links in emails that contained HTML code. There had been concern previously that the issue affected the core protocol of PGP, but that looks not to be the case. A website explaining the issue has been set up, and it advises users to disable HTML renderings in emails sent via PGP \\u2013 this will blockade the biggest opportunity for the vulnerability to be exploited. MIT researchers use cryptography to protect genomic study participants Researchers from MIT and Stanford University have developed a new system for protecting the privacy of people who contribute their genomic data to large-scale biomedical studies. At the core of the new system is a technique known as secret sharing, which divides sensitive information among a multitude of servers. As long as one server is trustworthy, the researchers claim the system is secure and all servers would need to be hacked to extract data. The researchers successfully reproduced three genome-wide studies involving 23,00 individual genomes. The system should scale efficiently to 1m genomes, while protecting the private medical information of study subjects. Apple pulls apps abusing location services data collection GDPR is just under two weeks away, and historically privacy-focused Apple is kicking things into high gear when it comes to compliance on the App Store. According to Sophos , Apple is evaluating the privacy policies of developers, kicking them off the platform until they cut out any features that are in violation of Apple\\u2019s location data policies. Apple wants app developers to offer better explanations to users about how their data will be used; until then, apps will be pulled. Google to warn users when they are chatting with Duplex AI Google\\u2019s new Duplex AI system lets AI mimic a human voice to make appointments. However, the experimental system has been on the receiving end of scrutiny since it was debuted at Google I/O. The company said that Duplex would have \\u201cdisclosure built-in\\u201d, which will involve a verbal announcement to the person that they are speaking to an AI system when trying to book a blow-dry or a medical appointment, for example. Google said: \\u201cWe are designing this feature with disclosure built-in, and we\\u2019ll make sure the system is appropriately identified.\\u201d AIB ATM .

No code or policy can anticipate every situation that may arise or replace the thoughtful behavior of an ethical director. This Code is intended to serve as a set of guiding principles for Directors and, among other things, to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and its implementing regulations. Questions or issues regarding this Code may be brought to the attention of the chair of the Company\\\\'s Corporate Governance Committee or the Chairman of the Board, as appropriate. Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest may arise when an individual\\\\'s private interest interferes in any way, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict situation may arise when a Director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work objectively and effectively due to the influence of private interest. Private interests may include, but are not limited to, outside activities, financial or other business interests, personal or charitable relationships or political interests or offices. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a Director, or a member of his or her immediate family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company, including loans or guarantees of obligations. A Director may not be involved in a business transaction in which the Director has a conflict of interest with the Company. Anything that could present a conflict of interest for a Director may also present a conflict of interest if it is related to a member of his or her immediate family. Because potential conflicts of interest may not always be clear cut, any material transaction or relationship that involves, or may involve, a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest with the Company should be disclosed promptly to the chair of the Company\\\\'s Corporate Governance Committee or the Chairman of the Board, who may consult with legal counsel, as appropriate. Corporate Opportunities and Company Assets Directors owe a duty to the Company to advance the Company\\\\'s business interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Directors may not take a business opportunity (or direct a business opportunity to a third party) that is discovered through the use of Company property, information or position, unless the Company has already been offered the opportunity and determined that it will not pursue that opportunity. Directors may not use Company property, information or position for personal gain or to compete with the Company and, when using Company assets, Directors are expected to use those assets for legitimate Company business only. Confidentiality In overseeing the Company and its business, Directors may learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company, its customers, clients, suppliers, joint venture partners or other third parties. Directors are expected to maintain the confidentiality of all information so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Fair Dealing To the extent applicable to the performance of their duties, Directors should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company\\\\'s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees and Directors are expected not to take unfair advantage of anyone in connection with the Company\\\\'s business and affairs through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, or misrepresentation of material facts, and directors are expected not to engage in any unlawful unfair-dealing practice. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations Directors are expected to comply with all laws and governmental rules and regulations applicable to the performance of their duties. Director transactions in Company securities are governed by the Company\\\\'s policies and include adherence to laws governing insider trading. It is a violation of the Company\\\\'s policy, and a violation of federal securities laws, for a Director to trade in Company securities while in possession of material non-public information about the Company. In addition, a Director may not trade securities in other companies if the Director is in possession of material non-public information about that company and the information was obtained through the Director\\\\'s relationship with the Company. Ethical Behavior by Employees, Reporting Suspected Illegal or Unethical Behavior Directors should support the Company\\\\'s efforts to encourage employees to talk to their supervisors and appropriate personnel when in doubt about the best course of action for employees to pursue in a particular situation. Directors should also support the Company\\\\'s efforts to encourage employees to report violations of laws, rules, regulations or the Company\\\\'s codes of business conduct to appropriate personnel and support the Company\\\\'s assurances that employees will not be retaliated against for reports made in good faith. Directors should communicate any concerns relating to, or suspected violations of, this Code promptly to the chair of the Company\\\\'s Corporate Governance Committee or the Chairman of the Board, as appropriate. Violations of this Code are to be investigated by the Board or by persons designated by the Board, and appropriate action is expected to be taken in the event any violation of this Code is determined to exist. Director Performance Directors are expected to carry out their responsibilities under the Code by exercising good business judgment, acting in good faith, and acting in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Amendments, Waiver of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Any amendment to this Code or waiver of this Code may be made only by the Board upon recommendation of the Company\\\\'s Corporate Governance Committee. Any waiver approved by the Board will be promptly disclosed to the Company\\\\'s shareholders. Additional Downloadable Resources Code of Ethics and Standards of Behavior for DTE Energy* The DTE Energy Way applies to employees of all DTE Energy companies, and comprises our code of ethics and the standards that guide our business practices and our behavior toward each other, our customers, shareholders, the government, and other stakeholders. GV-5 Officer Code of Business Conduct and Ethics* DTE Energy Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, DTE Energy or the Company) have a standard of conduct, The DTE Energy Way, applicable to all employees of the Company.

CurrentAssets CurrentLiabilities = - Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E) The financial reporting of both companies and investment research services use a basic earnings per share (EPS) figure divided into the current stock price to calculate the P/E multiple (i.e. how many times a stock is trading (its price) per each dollar of EPS). price (netIncome / shareNumber) = - Price to Sales Ratio The P/E ratio and P/S reflects how many times investors are paying for every dollar of a company\\\\'s sales. Since earnings are subject, to one degree or another, to accounting estimates and management manipulation, many investors consider a company\\\\'s sales (revenue) figure a more reliable ratio component in calculating a stock\\\\'s price multiple than the earnings figure. price (revenue / shareNumber) = - Price-to-Cash Flow ratio (P/CF) The price/cash flow ratio is used by investors to evaluate the investment attractiveness, from a value standpoint, of a company\\\\'s stock. price (operatingCashFlow / shareNumber) = - Price to Free Cash Flow Ratio (PFCF) The total value of all outstanding shares of a stock by its free cash flow. marketCap freeCashFlow = - Price-to-Book (PB) Ratio The price-to-book value ratio, expressed as a multiple (i.e. how many times a company\\\\'s stock is trading per share compared to the company\\\\'s book value per share), is an indication of how much shareholders are paying for the net assets of a company. price (totalStockHolderEquity / shareNumber) = - Sales Ratio to Enterprise value-to-sales Scales how the market values a company\\\\'s sales in the context of its enterprise value. enterpriseValue revenue = - Enterprise Value (EV) Measure of a company\\\\'s total value, taking into account its market capitalization and also its debt and cash. marketCap - cashAndCashEquivalents + totalDebt = - Enterprise Value Over EBITDA A comparison between a company\\\\'s EV to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. enterpriseValue ebitda = - Enterprise Value To Operating Cash Flow A comparison between a company\\\\'s EV to its operating cash flow. enterpriseValue operatingCashFlow = - Earnings Yield The company\\\\'s EPS as a percentage of its current market price per share. >(netIncome / shareNumber) price = - Free Cash Flow Yield The company\\\\'s free cash flow per share as a percentage of its current market price per share. freeCashFlow marketCap = - Debt To Equity A ratio of a company\\\\'s total debt to its total equity. Long Term Debt totalStockHolderEquity = - Debt To Assets A ratio of a company\\\\'s total debt to its total assets. Long Term Debt totalAsset = - Net Debt To EBITDA A ratio that compares a company\\\\'s net debt to its earnings before intersection, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. >(totalDebt - cashAndCashEquivalents) ebitda = - Interest Coverage The lower a company\\u2019s interest coverage ratio is, the more its debt expenses burden the company. ebit interestExpense = - Income Quality A measure of the sustainability and reliability of a company\\\\'s reported income. operatingCashFlow netIncome = - Dividend Yield Income investors value a dividend-paying stock, while growth investors have little interest in dividends, preferring to capture large capital gains. Whatever your investing style, it is a matter of historical record that dividend-paying stocks have performed better than non-paying-dividend stocks over the long term. >(dividendPaid / shareNumber) price = - Payout Ratio The dividend payout ratio is an indicator of how well earnings support the dividend payment. dividendPaid netIncome = - Sales General and Administrative To Revenue A metric that assesses the efficiency of a company\\\\'s operating cost structure. salesAndAdmin revenue = - Return On Tangible Assets A metric that measures a company\\\\'s ability to generate earnings from its tangible assets. netIncome (totalAsset - inntangibleAsset) = - Working Capital A metric that represents the difference between a company\\\\'s current assets and current liabilities. totalCurrentAssets - totalCurrentLiabilities = - Tangible Asset Value The total monetary worth of a company\\\\'s physical assets that have a clear market value and are used in its operations. totalAsset - inntangibleAsset - totalLiabilities = - Net Current Asset Value A metric that represents the difference between a company\\\\'s current assets and total liabilities. totalCurrentAsset - totalLiabilities = - Average Receivables The average amount of accounts receivable that a company has over a specific period. >(accountReceivables + lastReceivable) 2 = - Receivables Turnover A metric that measures how efficiently a company manages its accounts receivables. revenue accountReceivables = - Revenue Per Share The amount of revenue generated by a company for each outstanding share of its common stock. revenue shareNumber = - Interest Debt Per Share The amount of debt a company has for each outstanding share of its common stock. >(debt + shortTermdebt + interestExpense) shareNumber = - Return on Equity (ROE) ROE this ratio calculates how much money is made based on the investors\\\\' investment in the company.investors want to see a high return on equity ratio because this indicates that the company is using its investors\\\\' funds effectively. netIncome totalStockHolderEquity = - Capex Per Share The capital expenditures (Capex) incurred by a company divided by the number of outstanding shares. It represents investments in long-term assets, such as equipment or property, that are expected to provide future benefits. capex shareNumber = - Quick Ratio The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio because it excludes inventory and other current assets, which generally are more difficult to turn into cash. A higher quick ratio means a more liquid current position. >(cashAndCashEquivalents + shortTermInvestments + accountReceivables) totalCurrentLiabilities = - Cash Ratio The cash ratio is almost like an indicator of a firm\\u2019s value under the worst-case scenario where the company is about to go out of business. cashAndCashEquivalents totalCurrentLiabilities = - Gross Profit Margin The amount of money from product sales left over after all of the direct costs associated with manufacturing the product have been paid. grossProfit revenue = - Return on Assets (ROA) ROAs give an indication of the capital intensity of the company, which will depend on the industry; companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets. ROAs over 5% are generally considered good. netIncome totalAsset = - Return on Equity ROE this ratio calculates how much money is made based on the investors\\\\' investment in the company.investors want to see a high return on equity ratio because this indicates that the company is using its investors\\\\' funds effectively. netIncome totalStockHolderEquity = - Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) ROCE shows investors how many dollars in profits each dollar of capital employed generates. operatingProfit ((averageTotalAssets \\u2212 averageCurrentLiabilities) / 2) = - Company Equity Multiplier A measure of financial leverage. totalAsset totalStockHolderEquity = - Net Income Per EBT NIperEBT. netIncome incomeBeforeTaxes = - Long Term Debt to Capitalization While a high capitalization ratio can increase the return on equity because of the tax shield of debt, a higher proportion of debt increases the risk of bankruptcy for a company. debt (debt + totalStockHolderEquity) = - Total Debt to Capitalization Capitalization ratio describes to investors the extent to which a company is using debt to fund its business and expansion plans. >(debt + shortTermdebt) (shortTermdebt + debt + totalStockHolderEquity) = - Fixed Asset Turnover Calculates how efficiently a company is a producing sales with its machines and equipment. revenue netPPE = - Operating Cash Flow Sales Ratio Gives investors an idea of the company\\\\'s ability to turn sales into cash. operatingCashFlow revenue = - Free Cash Flow Operating Cash Flow Ratio The higher the percentage of free cash flow embedded in a company\\\\'s operating cash flow, the greater the financial strength of the company. freeCashFlow operatingCashFlow = - Cash Flow Coverage Ratios The operating cash flow is simply the amount of cash generated by the company from its main operations, which are used to keep the business funded. operatingCashFlow (shortTermdebt + debt) = - Short Term Coverage Ratios The short-term debt coverage ratio compares the sum of a company\\\\'s short-term borrowings and the current portion of its long-term debt to operating cash flow. operatingCashFlow shortTermdebt = - Capital Expenditure Coverage Ratio The larger the operating cash flow coverage for these items, the greater the company\\\\'s ability to meet its obligations, along with giving the company more cash flow to expand its business, withstand hard times, and not be burdened by debt servicing and the restrictions typically included in credit agreements. operatingCashFlow capex = - Dividend Paid and Capex Coverage Ratio For conservative investors focused on cash flow coverage, comparing the sum of a company\\\\'s capital expenditures and cash dividends to its operating cash flow is a stringent measurement that puts cash flow to the ultimate test. If a company is able to cover both of these outlays of funds from internal sources and still have cash left over, it is producing what might be called \\\"free cash flow on steroids\\\". This circumstance is a highly favorable investment quality. operatingCashFlow (capex + dividendPaid) = - Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) DSO tells you how many days after the sale it takes people to pay you on average. >(AccountReceivable(start)+AccountReceivable(end))/2 revenue/365 = - Days of Inventory Outstanding (DIO) DIO tells you how many days inventory sits on the shelf on average. >(Inventories(start)+Inventories(end))/2 COGS/365 = - Operating Cycle (DSO + DIO )Basically the Operating Cycle tells you how many days it takes for something to go from first being in inventory to receiving the cash after the sale. Days of Sales Outstanding + Days of Inventory Outstanding = - Days of Payables Outstanding (DPO) DPO tells you how many days the company takes to pay its suppliers. >(AccountsPayable(start)+AccountsPayable(end))/2 COGS/365 = - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) The cash conversion cycle (CCC = DSO + DIO \\u2013 DPO) measures the number of days a company\\\\'s cash is tied up in the production and sales process of its operations and the benefit it derives from payment terms from its creditors. The shorter this cycle, the more liquid the company\\\\'s working capital position is. The CCC is also known as the \\\"cash\\\" or \\\"operating\\\" cycle. Days of Sales Outstanding + Days of Inventory Outstanding + Days of Payables Outstanding = - Operating Profit Margin If companies can make enough money from their operations to support the business, the company is usually considered more stable. OperatingIncome revenue = - Pretax Profit Margin Profit is the main goal of for-profit organizations. The goal is to make a profit through growth and to grow every year. As a result, one of the most important roles of the financial and investment analyst is to track and forecast profitability. IncomeBeforeTax revenue = - Net Profit Margin Generally, a net profit margin in excess of 10% is considered excellent, though it depends on the industry and the structure of the business. NetIncome revenue = - Effective Tax Rate If there\\u2019s one takeaway, it should be that a company\\u2019s tax situation is all but a living, breathing organism in its own right. ProvisionForIncomeTaxes IncomeBeforeTax = - EBTperEBIT EBTperEBIT. EBT EBIT = - EBITperRevenue EBITperRevenue EBIT revenue = - Debt Ratio The debt ratio tells us the degree of leverage used by the company. TotalLiabilities TotalAssets = - Debt Equity Ratio This is a measurement of the percentage of the company\\u2019s balance sheet that is financed by suppliers, lenders, creditors and obligors versus what the shareholders have committed. totalLiabilities totalStockHolderEquity = - Cash Flow to Debt Ratio The cash flow to debt ratio reveals the ability of a business to support its debt obligations from its operating cash flows. OperatingCashFlows TotalDebt = - Asset Turnover The Asset Turnover ratio can often be used as an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is deploying its assets in generating revenue. revenue TotalAssets = - Price Earnings to Growth Ratio (PEG) The PEG ratio is a refinement of the P/E ratio and factors in a stock\\\\'s estimated earnings growth into its current valuation.The general consensus is that if the PEG ratio indicates a value of 1, this means that the market is correctly valuing (the current P/E ratio) a stock in accordance with the stock\\\\'s current estimated earnings per share growth. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, this means that EPS growth is potentially able to surpass the market\\\\'s current valuation. In other words, the stock\\\\'s price is being undervalued. On the other hand, stocks with high PEG ratios can indicate just the opposite - that the stock is currently overvalued. PriceEarningsRatio ExpectedRevenueGrowth = - Enterprise Value Multiplier Overall, this measurement allows investors to assess a company on the same basis as that of an acquirer. As a rough calculation, enterprise value multiple serves as a proxy for how long it would take for an acquisition to earn enough to pay off its costs in years(assuming no change in EBITDA). EnterpriseValue EBITDA = - Price Fair Value Helps investors determine whether a stock is trading at, below, or above its fair value estimate,A price/fair value ratio below 1 suggests the stock is trading at a discount to its fair value, while a ratio above 1 suggests it is trading at a premium to its fair value. price IntrinsicValue = - Return on Invested Capital A metric that measures the efficiency and profitability of a company\\\\'s capital investments. operatingProfit\\u00d7(1\\u2212taxRate) (totalEquity+totalLongTermDebt) = - Payables Turnover A metric that measures how efficiently a company manages its accounts payable. CostOfRevenue AccountPayables = - Inventory Turnover A metric that measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory. A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates that a company is selling and replenishing its inventory quickly, which is generally considered favorable. CostOfRevenue Inventory = - Cash per Share A metric that represents the amount of cash a company has on hand for each outstanding share of its common stock. It provides insight into the liquidity and financial health of a company. It helps investors understand how much cash is available to support the company\\\\'s operations or pursue investment opportunities on a per-share basis. ShortTermInvestments+CashAndEquivalents Shares = - Free Cashflow per Share A metric that represents the amount of free cash flow generated by a company for each outstanding share of its common stock. It helps investors assess how much cash is available on a per-share basis after accounting for capital expenditures. FreeCashFlow Shares = - Operating Cashflow per Share A metric that represents the amount of cash generated from a company\\\\'s core operating activities for each outstanding share of its common stock. It provides insight into the cash-generating capability of a company\\\\'s primary business operations on a per-share basis. It is used by investors to evaluate the company\\\\'s ability to generate cash from its core activities and support its ongoing business.

Claim settlement ratio (CSR) is defined as the percentage of claims an insurance company has fulfilled of the total received claims during a financial year. Hence, this ratio indicates the credibility of an insurer. It also assures you of settling your insurance claim on time. The higher an insurer\\u2019s claim settlement ratio , the more you can rely on it. If a life insurance company has a very high claim settlement ratio, it is very likely to honour claims filed by the beneficiaries of a term plan . The number indicates the insurer\\\\'s trustworthiness, credibility, reliability and quality of service. The claim settlement ratios of life insurance companies are published on the official portal of IRDAI ( Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) under the Annual Reports section. What is Term Insurance? end When Should I Buy a Term Insurance Plan? start How Is Claim Settlement Ratio Calculated? Calculating the claim settlement ratio is straightforward. Here\\\\'s a simple formula you can use: Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) = (Number of Claims Settled / Number of Claims Received) \\u00d7 100 For example: Imagine a life insurance company receives 1,000 insurance claims over the year and manages to pay out on 996 of them. To find out how well they\\u2019re doing, you can use this formula: Claim Settlement Ratio = (Claims Settled \\u00f7 Total Claims) \\u00d7 100 Here, it would be: Claim Settlement Ratio = (996 \\u00f7 1,000) \\u00d7 100 = 99.6% So, the company successfully pays out on 99.6% of the claims it gets. <div class=\\\"row custom-margin\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\"col d-flex justify-content-center\\\">\\\\n    <h2 class=\\\"sec-title\\\">When Should I Buy a Term Insurance Plan?</h2>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\\\"col-md-12 text-center \\\">\\\\n    <p>The ideal time to buy a term plan is right away.

For a provider of a term life insurance plan , a claim settlement ratio of 90% or above is considered good. This is so because 90 percent indicates that the insurance provider has successfully settled 90 out of 100 claims during the financial year. The claim settlement ratio keeps on changing each year, depending on the number of claims the insurer has successfully settled. An insurance company completing claims above 95 per cent, an insurance buyer can stay assured that the company is secured financially.\\\\xa0HDFC Life has a claim settlement ratio of 99.50% for FY 2023-2024 with it, your nominees are assured of minimum hassles and fast claim processing. However, before selecting an insurance policy, it is necessary to consider other factors including the turnaround time of claims, online review of the insurer, sum assured offered and premium amount. What is a Term Insurance Rider? end Benefits of Buying Term Plan start Types of Insurance Claims There are two types of claims under life insurance policy i.e., death claims and maturity claims. Maturity Claims Maturity claims can be received once your policy matures. This amount however can be fixed or market-linked, depending on the type of your policy. Several life insurance policies such as retirement plans, ULIPs, savings plans, and endowment plans offer attractive maturity benefits. At the\\\\xa0end of your policy tenure, you can get a lump sum\\\\xa0amount after submitting all necessary documents as required by the insurance company. Death Claims Death claims are paid out if the policyholder dies during the policy term. It is paid to the policyholder\\\\'s nominee either as a regular income or a lump sum as chosen when\\\\xa0buying the policy. However, the nominee must produce all necessary documents such as a doctor\\\\'s certificate, proof of death, death certificate and more. Death benefit claims ensure\\\\xa0that the policyholder\\u2019s family is\\\\xa0capable of sustaining themselves financially in your absence. Benefits of Buying Term Plan end Types of Term Plan start Why is Claim Settlement Ratio Important? While purchasing a life insurance policy, there are several factors you must look into including the sum assured value, customer reviews and so on. However, it is crucial to consider the claim settlement ratio when you are researching for any life insurance provider. Here are the most important benefits of choosing a life insurance provider with a high claim settlement ratio : Assures Financial Security In case of a policyholder\\\\'s sudden\\\\xa0death, the amount his/her family receives from a life insurance policy provides them essential financial security. Often, when the breadwinner of a family passes away, the family members get overwhelmed with financial responsibilities. It can also be difficult for them to meet obligations like loan payments. In such a situation, a policy from an insurer with a high claim ratio ensures your family can support themselves financially.\\\\xa0A high claim settlement ratio is one of the benefits of term insurance . Depicts the Insurer\\u2019s Reliability To rely on an insurance company, it is crucial to look into whether\\\\xa0it maintains a high claim settlement ratio. A high claim settlement ratio indicates the life insurance company is capable of providing the sum\\\\xa0assured to the policyholder\\\\'s nominee, after the policyholder\\u2019s\\\\xa0sudden demise. Hence, if a life insurance company holds the highest claim ratio throughout, the insured person\\\\xa0can easily rely on the company to look after his/her family. Co-operation from the Insurer An insurance company\\u2019s high claim settlement ratio shows its concern for its policyholders and how much it cooperates with claimants. At the same time, policyholders get peace of mind that the insurer will settle their loved one\\u2019s claims quickly without hassles. Considering all of these benefits, make sure to go through the claim settlement ratio before you proceed to choose a provider for a life insurance plan . Types of Term Plan end When Should I Buy a Term Insurance Plan? start How Long Does it Take to Get the Claim Payout? The time taken to get the claim payout varies among the insurance companies and the type of insurance. As per the IRDAI, all claims should be settled within 30 days 1 from\\\\xa0the date of receipt of all relevant documents. During this period, the insurance company scrutinises the application, assesses the damage/loss, raises queries for additional information or documentation, and decides upon the approvals and rejections thereof. <div class=\\\"row custom-margin\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\"col d-flex justify-content-center\\\">\\\\n    <h2 class=\\\"sec-title\\\">When Should I Buy a Term Insurance Plan?</h2>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\\\"col-md-12 text-center \\\">\\\\n    <p>The ideal time to buy a term plan is right away.

The claim settlement ratio of a term insurance company is the percentage of settled term insurance claims divided by the total claims received during a financial year. 2 What is the formula for the claims ratio? You can represent the formula for the claim settlement ratio as: Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) = (Total number of settled claims / Total number of received claims) *100 3 How do you calculate the claim settlement ratio? The claim settlement ratio is calculated by dividing the total settled claims by the total received claims volume. 4 Why is proper disclosure critical for a better claim settlement ratio? Improper disclosure or non-disclosure means failing to reveal any fact that is creating an impact on the policy issuance decision in the proposal. Non-disclosure also leads to denial of the claim. Hence, it is recommended to provide proper disclosure to create a positive effect on the claim settlement ratio. 5 What is the timeframe for reporting a claim? There is no particular timeframe for reporting a claim. However, reporting a claim as soon as possible helps in faster processing. For disability claims, you need to report within 120 days from the date of disability. Moreover, it is essential to report the claim within 60 days for any surgery or critical illness. 6 Who qualifies to receive the claim benefit? The following individuals qualify to receive the claim benefits of a life insurance plan: Proposer, if you are not the life-assured Nominee, if you are the life-assured Individual to whom the policy is assigned at the time of purchase Life assured, if you are alive and enjoying all the benefit claims including any major illness, claims under disability and major surgery 7 What makes the claim settlement ratio important? A claim settlement ratio shows an insurance company\\\\'s ability to pay the claimed sum assured to you or the nominee. In case an insurer has a high claim settlement ratio, it indicates that there is less likelihood of default on payment of the sum assured. On the other hand, a low claim settlement ratio (CSR) indicates a higher chance of your claim getting rejected. 8 How do you check the claim settlement ratio? You can check any insurer\\\\'s claim settlement ratio through this formula: (Total number of claims settled in a year divided by total number of claims in a year), multiplied by 100. For example, if an insurance company has in the last year settled 9,700 out of 10,000 claims that it received, its claim settlement ratio turns out to be 97%.

Also, the prospective policyholders shall maintain transparency when it comes to an insurance policy because incorrect or false information could lead to rejection of the claim in the future. This defeats the very purpose of the insurance. Thus, going with an insurer who has a proven track record for faster and higher claim settlements can help policyholders meet their objectives. With an Insurance Claim Settlement Ratio that is one of the highest in the country, HDFC Life has been consistently protecting the policyholders whenever things went south.

More detailed and additional information on the corporate governance structures in place across the Group is also available in the Corporate Governance Section of the Annual Financial Report each year available here . Corporate Governance Framework The Group\\u2019s Governance Framework underpins effective decision-making and accountability. It is the basis on which the Group conducts its business and engages with customers and stakeholders. It ensures that organisational and control arrangements are appropriate to the governance of the Group\\u2019s strategy and operations and the mitigation of related material risks. This framework encompasses AIB Group plc and its subsidiaries. Corporate Governance Requirements and Codes AIB\\u2019s corporate governance practices meet the many statutory and regulatory obligations that apply to the Group including various corporate governance codes, regulations and best practice standards and guidelines, Irish company law, the Listing Rules of the Main Securities Market of Euronext Dublin and the London Stock Exchange, the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and, for UK businesses, UK company law. As a credit institution, AIB is subject to the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland\\u2019s Corporate Governance Requirements for Credit Institutions, including requirements which specifically relate to \\u2018high impact institutions\\u2019. Additional corporate governance obligations for significant credit institutions are met for the purposes of the European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulations 2014 (CRD) (which transposed the EU Capital Requirements Directive into domestic law).

The document which sets out how AIB complies with the requirements of Regulations 76 to 83 of CRD, which relate primarily to Governance, Remuneration, and Reporting, can be found here . How Our Board Operates The Group is headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible for the long-term sustainable success of the Group, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. The Board, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is supported by the Executive Committee, being the most senior management committee of the Group. The Board is responsible for maintaining effective oversight of the Group consistent with Board approved policy. The Board maintains a clear division of responsibilities, including between the Chair, who is responsible for the overall leadership of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness, and the CEO, who manages and leads the business.\\\\xa0The governance framework and organisational structure are sufficient to ensure that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision or exercises excessive influence.\\\\xa0Key roles and responsibilities and a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for Board decision are clearly defined, documented and communicated to key stakeholders on this site. Key Roles and Responsibilities The Board is responsible for corporate governance, encompassing leadership, direction and control of the Group. It assesses the basis on which the Group generates and preserves value over the long term and is accountable to shareholders for financial performance.\\\\xa0The Board is also responsible for approving high-level policy and strategic direction in relation to the nature and scale of risk that the Group is prepared to assume in order to achieve its strategic objectives, and for maintaining an appropriate system of internal controls. While arrangements have been made by the Directors for delegation of the management, organisation and administration of the Group\\u2019s affairs, certain matters are specifically reserved for decision by the Board which are available here . Relationship with the Irish State The Group has received significant support from the Irish State in the context of the financial crisis due to its systemic importance to the Irish financial system. Following a reduction in its shareholding during 2017, and further reductions in 2022, 2023 and 2024, as at 26 September 2024, the State holds 20.99% of the issued ordinary shares of AIB Group plc. The relationship between the Group and the State is governed by a Relationship Framework. Within the Relationship Framework, with the exception of a number of important items requiring advance consultation with or approval by the State, the Board retains responsibility and authority for all of the operations and business of the Group in accordance with its legal and fiduciary duties and retains responsibility and authority for ensuring compliance with the Group\\u2019s regulatory and legal obligations. Board Meetings The Chair and the Chairs of each Committee ensure Board and Committee meetings are structured to facilitate open discussion, constructive challenge and debate. The Board receives a comprehensive Executive Management report on a regular basis. The remainder of its agenda is built from the indicative annual work programme, strategic items for consideration, any activities out of the ordinary course of business, requested in depth reviews and scheduled updates on key projects. There is a set escalation process in place through Executive and Board Committees which ensures the Board receives the necessary information at the appropriate time to enable the right decisions to be taken. The Chair leads the agenda setting process, supported by the CEO and Company Secretary. Attendance at Board meetings and Board Committee meetings is outlined in the Corporate Governance chapter and the respective Committee reports within the Annual Financial Report here . The Non-Executive Directors also meet on a number of occasions every year in the absence of the Executive Directors. Board Effectiveness and Performance Evaluation The Board conducts an annual evaluation of its effectiveness, and is required to have an external evaluation conducted once every three years. The Chair of the Board leads the annual review of the Board\\u2019s effectiveness, that of its Committees and individual Directors with the support of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee. The aim of these evaluations is to review the Board\\u2019s composition, expertise, diversity and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives. Full details of the most recent Effectiveness Evaluation can be found in the Annual Financial Report here . Conflicts of Interest The Board approved Code of Conduct and Conflicts of Interest Policy for Directors sets out how actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest are to be evaluated, reported and managed to ensure that Directors act at all times in the best interests of the Group and its stakeholders. Executive Directors, as employees of the Group, are also subject to the Group\\u2019s Code of Conduct and Conflicts of Interests Policy for employees. Diversity Employee diversity and inclusion in AIB Group is addressed through policy, practices and values which recognise that a productive workforce comprises different work styles, cultures, generations, genders and ethnic backgrounds. AIB Group opposes all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination. The efficacy of related policy and practices and the embedding of the Group\\u2019s values is overseen by the Board. The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity among its own Members, including diversity of skills, experience, background, gender and other qualities and is committed to achieving the most appropriate blend and balance of diversity possible over time. While the Board recognises that the diversity is wider than gender, in order to maintain its objective of a diverse Board, it has set measurable targets and objectives around the under-represented gender in its Board Diversity Policy. At 31 December 2023, the percentage of females on the Board stood at 40% and thus achieved the target of 40% set out in the Policy. A copy of the Board Diversity Policy which applies to the Group is available here . Board Committees The Board is assisted in fulfilling its duties by a number of Board Committees, whose purpose it is to consider, in greater depth than would be practicable at Board meetings, matters for which the Board retains responsibility.

The Board The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term, sustainable success of the AIB Group and ensuring that there is a clear and cohesive corporate governance structure in place. The Board comprises the Chair, Independent Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors. - Chair The Chair leads the Board, setting its agenda, ensuring Directors receive adequate, accurate and timely information, facilitating the effective contribution of the Non- Executive Directors, ensuring the proper induction of new Directors, the on-going training and development of all Directors, and reviewing the performance of individual Directors. The role of the Chair is separate from the role of the CEO, with clearly-defined responsibilities attaching to each; these are set out in writing and agreed by the Board. - Deputy Chair The Deputy Chair, who may be appointed from time to time, deputises in the absence of the Chair. The Deputy Chair would assume the role of the Chair for Board meetings and other tasks as required from time to time. - Senior Independent Director The Senior Independent Director (\\u201cSID\\u201d), acts as a conduit for the views of shareholders and is available as an alternate point of contact to address any concerns or issues they feel have not been adequately dealt with through the usual channels of communication. The SID also leads the annual review of the Chair\\u2019s performance and succession planning for the Chair\\u2019s role. The SID attends meetings with major shareholders to listen to their views in order to develop a balanced understanding of the issues of concern to them. - Independent Non-Executive Directors As an integral component of the Board, Independent Non-Executive Directors represent a key layer of oversight of the activities of the Group. In their role, Independent Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of management in their objectives and monitor their reporting on performance. They bring an independent viewpoint to the deliberations of the Board that is objective and independent of the activities of the management and of the Group. They constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and other key matters. - Executive Directors Executive Directors have executive functions in the Group in addition to their Board duties. The role of Executive Directors, led by the CEO, is to propose strategies to the Board and, following challenging Board scrutiny, to execute the agreed strategies to the highest possible standards.

This process includes an assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls, which accords with the Central Bank of Ireland\\u2019s Corporate Governance Requirements for Credit Institutions 2015 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Show authors Part of the book series Springer Proceedings in Physics volume 393 Included in the following conference series World Hydrogen Technology Convention 3509 Accesses Abstract Hydrogen fuel is an extremely ideal aviation power with its characteristics of high power density and zero carbon emission Hydrogen fuel is stored in a lowtemperature liquid state in aircraft and the liquid hydrogen needs to be warmed up to hydrogen gas by heat transfer before entering the combustion chamber to participate in combustion Since liquid hydrogen has the traits of low temperature and high specific heat capacity large amount of heat is required to complete the heat transfer process And the engine thermal cycle process can be fully utilized for heat transfer of liquid hydrogen This paper presents the design and verification of unconventional thermal cycle system based on an unconventional thermal cycle configuration for hydrogen aeroturbine engines under the existing airworthiness regulations This paper can provide support for the airworthiness design and verification of hydrogen aeroturbine engines with unconventional thermal cycle configurations and provide a reference for the

The rapid growth of the air transport industry has made aviation emissions one of the main sources of pollution emissions in the transportation sector and the impact of aircraft on climate and the environment has become more and more significant among which carbon dioxide emissions have received the most attention from governments The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in June 1992 first proposed comprehensive control of carbon dioxide emissions  1  the Kyoto Protocol signed in 1997 began seeking to cut greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft and ships and proposed the idea of carbon trading  2  The European Union adopted Directive 2008101EC in November 2008 to include the aviation industry in the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading System ETS  3  ICAO added the “Environmental Technical Paper Annex 16 Volume 3” in March 2017 which specifies the calculation method and limitation standards for aircraft carbon emissions  4  China’s 2021 In the 14th FiveYear Plan of China the goal of “double carbon” is also clearly proposed striving to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and neutral carbon emissions by 2060  5  in the newly revised CCAR34 “Turbine Engine Emissions and Exhaust Emissions” by Civil Aviation Administration of China CAAC in 2022 In 2022 “Aircraft Fuel Discharge and Exhaust Emissions Regulations” of the Civil Aviation Administration of China CAAC also clarified the calculation method and limitation requirements for aircraft carbon emissions  6  Under the guidance of a series of civil aviation transportation lowcarbon and energysaving emission reduction requirements in addition to the continuous optimization of traditional gas turbine engine design and aircraft operating procedures new aviation power technologies such as hydrogen energy and electric motors have also seen vigorous development Among them hydrogen aeroturbine engine has the advantage of high power density because it directly uses part or all of liquid hydrogen as fuel and can be adapted on the basis of the existing configuration of gas turbine engines without making disruptive design changes to the current aircraft and aeroengine configuration so hydrogen aeroturbine engine has a great potential to realize the civil aviation industry’s “double carbon” goal in civil aviation Hydrogen fuel is stored in ultralow temperature liquid form in aircraft and needs to be heated to gaseous state by unconventional thermodynamic cycle which is different from that of conventional gas turbine aeroengine before participating in combustion In this paper the design and verification of the unconventional thermodynamic cycle configuration of hydrogen aeroturbine engine is proposed based on the safety principle under the existing CCAR33 aeroengine airworthiness regulations 2 Unconventional Thermodynamic Cycle Hydrogen Power Scheme The ultralow temperature usually below − 260 °C liquid hydrogen fuel in the aircraft storage tank cannot be directly mixed with petroleum hydrocarbon fuel through direct atomization but needs to be transformed into hydrogen gas through heat exchange and warming before entering the combustion chamber Liquid hydrogen is one of the liquids with the highest specific heat capacity which is about 5000xa0Jkgxa0K and it consumes a lot of heat in the heat exchange process In this context the onboard electric heating supplemented by unconventional thermodynamic cycle engine modification design so that the hydrogen as a fuel at the same time takes on the cooling function of the engine thermal cycle can greatly reduce the extra energy consumption of liquid hydrogen heat exchange warming and improve the engine performance  7  8  and thus improve the economy of the engine The purpose of using unconventional thermodynamic cycle hydrogen power scheme is to make full use of the engine thermal cycle to raise the temperature of liquid hydrogen and improve the performance of the engine The current unconventional thermodynamic cycle schemes that can better heat the liquid hydrogen and significantly improve the engine performance are mainly two kinds of compress flow path precooling CPC and turbine cooling gas precooling TPC The core structure of the compressor flow path precooling scheme is the precooler installed on the wall of the booster stage cassette The lead pipe introduces part of the air after the fan into the precooler which is cooled down by liquid hydrogen precooling and then pressurized and discharged into the core The principle of this scheme is to reduce the total inlet gas temperature in front of the core machine booster pole increase the total temperature rise of the compressor and thus increase the pressurization ratio of the compressor thus improve the efficiency of the compressor and reduce the fuel consumption rate For the gas entering the compressor the isentropic temperature ratio can be simplified as a relationship with the pressure ratio see  1   fracT2S T1   left fracP2 P1  rightfrackappa  1kappa   1 T1 is the inlet temperature of the compressor K T2s is the end temperature of the isentropic

is shown in Fig 1  Figxa01 Compressor flow path precooling scheme Full size image The core structure of the turbine cooling gas precooling solution is an external precooler installed between the highpressure compressor and the turbine The lead pipe introduces the turbine cooling gas from the highpressure compressor into the external precooler where the cooling gas is further cooled by liquid hydrogen and then used for impact cooling and air film cooling of the turbine blades The turbine efficiency is used to measure the extent to which hysteresis isentropic work is converted to actual

cooling gas temperature through the heat exchanger can significantly improve the cooling effect of the turbine allowing the turbine to withstand higher temperatures based on the existing design increasing the turbine inlet temperature T4 and improving the turbine efficiency ηT4 while reducing the fuel consumption rate Fig 2  Figxa02 Turbine flow path precooling scheme Full size image In the European cryogenic civil aircraft project CRYOPLANE researchers have simulated the performance of a turbofan engine in two hydrogenfueled unconventional thermodynamic cycle modes based on the performance parameters of a V2527A5 engine  9  The result indicates that engine using unconventional thermodynamic cycle has significant improvement on efficiency as shown in Fig 3  Figxa03 Performance improvement with unconventional thermodynamic cycle Full size image The hydrogen turbine engine with unconventional thermodynamic cycle design has excellent performance however there are differences in configuration between the modified engine and the premodification engine whether using the pressurized flow path precooling or turbine cooling gas precooling scheme and the design changes need to be supplemented with the airworthiness design and verification of the unconventional thermodynamic cycle system 3 Unconventional Thermodynamic Cycle Airworthiness Compliance Design and Verification According to the two solutions of unconventional thermodynamic cycle hydrogen power the main differences between the configuration and before modification are mainly in the compressor flow path precooling device and turbine cooling gas precooling device and the airworthiness design should be carried out for the compressor flow path precooling structure and turbine cooling gas precooling structure under the principle of security analysis 31 Design of Precooling Device for Compressor Flow Path The precooling device of the compressor flow path does precooling on the front end of the engine thermal cycle and is also installed on the front end of the engine which bring the influence of icing and foreign matter inhalation into consideration when doing the airworthiness compliance design According to the icing requirements of the airworthiness regulations for the intake system the engine should not have icing conditions on engine components that affect engine operation or cause serious loss of power or thrust during its operation over its entire flight power range A pressurized flow path precooling device installed in front of the booster pole will make the risk of icing near the manifold ring significantly increased especially in the highaltitude and lowtemperature environment traditional gas turbine engines often need to install hot gas antiicing devices to prevent the manifold ring icing the aeroengine icing phenomenon is shown in Fig 4  Figxa04 Aeroengine icing Full size image Therefore it is necessary to carry out the airworthiness compliance design of the control system for the precooling device of the compressor flow path accordingly and open the precooling device in front of the booster pole when the total temperature of the inlet air is high to reduce the total temperature in front of the fan booster pole to improve the boost ratio and keep the precooling device closed when the total temperature of the inlet air drops to a certain threshold In addition the total temperature sensor is set at the outlet of the precooling device and the lowtemperature shutdown temperature control logic is also set to automatically shut down the precooling device if the airflow is excessively cooled during the normal operation of the precooling device and the total outlet temperature drops to a level that may cause icing In accordance with the requirements of the Airworthiness Regulations for inhalation of foreign objects no unacceptable mechanical damage loss of sustained power or thrust or engine stoppage shall be caused in the event that flying birds ice or large hail are inhaled the aeroengine suction bird is shown in Fig 5  Figxa05 Aeroengine bird strike Full size image The precooling device of the compressor flow path is installed on the wall of the booster box and there is a certain probability that birds ice and large hailstones will hit the precooling device when it is sucked into the engine and there is a large amount of liquid hydrogen used for heat exchange in the precooling device which may cause liquid hydrogen leakage and fire if it is hit by foreign objects Therefore it is necessary to design the airworthiness of the precooling device of the compressor flow path for structural strength and conduct strength assessments to ensure that its structure and installation will not be damaged under the conditions of inhalation of foreign objects as required by airworthiness regulations 32 Turbine Cooling Gas Precooling Device Airworthiness Compliance Design Turbine cooling gas precooling device to do precooling of the engine thermal cycle of the cooling gas in doing airworthiness compliance design should mainly consider the impact of the cooling gas temperature range According to the airworthiness regulations for engine cooling the engine must be designed and constructed to provide the necessary cooling under the intended operating conditions of the aircraft Conventional configurations of aircraft turbine engines usually use a highpressure compressor intermediate or final stage to induce gas to cool the turbine blades The gas from the highpressure compressor enters through the induced gas line from the hollow turbine blade roots and forms a gas film on the turbine blade surface to cool the turbine blades which can isolate the flame and significantly reduce the temperature of the turbine blade body the air film cooling structure is shown in Fig 6  Figxa06 Schematic diagram of hollow turbine blade air film cooling Full size image The temperature of the air after multistage pressurization by the highpressure compressor has a significant increase and the total temperature of the highpressure compressor outlet of large turbofan engines can usually reach more than 350xa0K After using the turbo cooling air precooling device to precool the air leading from the highpressure compressor the temperature of the cooling air can be effectively reduced to enhance the cooling effect and further increase the temperature before the turbine However the turbine cooling air is not allowed to be overly precooled If the cold air is used directly for cooling the hot end components it may produce too large a temperature gradient and lead to thermal stress problems in the turbine blades and other hot end components Therefore it is necessary to design the turbine cooling gas precooling device to comply with the temperature range of the cooling gas Determine the temperature range of the cooling gas that can be used for direct cooling according to the temperature field and thermal stress calculation results of the turbine blades and other hot end components Then set the control logic of the turbine cooling gas precooling device according to the determined temperature range of the cooling gas 33 Unconventional Thermodynamic Cycle System Airworthiness Compliance Verification Ideas The precooling device in the unconventional thermodynamic cycle system designed according to the above principles as an accessory of the engine also needs to pass the corresponding environmental test according to the requirements of 3391 The design and verification of the piping for transporting liquid hydrogen needs to meet the requirements of 3317 Fire Resistance 3363 External Component Vibration 3364 Overpressure etc Therefore the design and verification of the unconventional thermodynamic cycle system represented by the precooling of the compressor flow path and the precooling of the turbine cooling gas is shown in the Fig 7  Figxa07 Unconventional thermodynamic cycle system design and verification ideas Full size image When carrying out airworthiness verification under the current system of aeroengine airworthiness regulations the verification of unconventional thermodynamic cycle systems can fall under the existing CCAR3368 CCAR3377 and dozens of other provisions of the conformity work and the specific conformity verification methods can be determined in consultation with the airworthiness authorities in conjunction with the industrial side’s technology maturity assessment and verification strategy For all evidence of conformity shown to the bureau it is necessary to prove the validity of the evidence through test verification or validated methods 34 Potential Special Conditions During the airworthiness review process the Bureau will establish special conditions for novel and unique design features that do not contain sufficient safety requirements in the regulations According to CCAR21 Civil Aviation Product and Component Qualification Validation  10  Sectionxa02116 of the regulations governs the special conditions as follows Table 1  Tablexa01 Civil aviation administration of China special conditions requirements Full size table The design of turbine engines using hydrogen as fuel especially the unconventional thermodynamic cycle design in this paper is highly novel and the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen differ greatly from those of conventional fuel which is highly flammable and explosive In the previous paper we have carried out airworthiness design and verification of unconventional thermodynamic cycle system taking the verification of piping for liquid hydrogen transport as an example If not when the applicant adopts the design of unconventional thermodynamic cycle the corresponding special conditions should be introduced by the airworthiness authority 4 Conclusion and Outlook This paper focuses on the unconventional thermodynamic cycle scheme adopted in conventional aeroturbine engines and carries out the airworthiness design and verification of the unconventional thermodynamic cycle system which can provide ideas for the airworthiness of conventional gas turbine engines converted to hydrogenpowered configurations At the same time due to storage transport ignition and explosion characteristics compressibility of hydrogen differ greatly from those of traditional fuel and there is hydrogen corrosion effect on metal materials further design and verification of fire protection component durability and operating characteristics of the whole engine are needed in addition to the design and verification for compliance of unconventional thermodynamic cycle systems focused on in this paper and based on the results of safety assessment the airworthiness authorities and industry will identify the current novel or unique design features and timely introduction of the corresponding special conditions References UN United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UN Rio de Janeiro 1992 Google Scholar UN Kyoto Protocol UN Tokyo 1997 Google Scholar EU DIRECTIVE 2008101EC EU Brussels

the present status and future plans for the Chinese civil aviation and aerospace sector and are there business opportunities for UK companies BILL READ FRAeS reports on a recent RAeS webinar On 20 May the RAeS hosted a webinar featuring a presentation from Prof Dennis Scott FRAeS Assistant Chief Designer COMAC who gave an update on the current domestic situation in China with regard to the Covid19 pandemic together with an overview of the Chinese civil aviation sector its plans for the future and the business opportunities for western aerospace companies which want to become involved Professor Scott has been involved in aircraft development and production for over 40 years and has worked for COMAC Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China since 2011 providing technical guidance certification support supplier management business strategy and comprehensive training China reemerges The Chinese city of Wuhan where the Covid19 pandemic first started has now reopened its airport Professor Scott began by giving an overview of how China’s aerospace industry is coping with the restrictions imposed by the outbreak of Covid19 He explained how China is recovering well from the Coronavirus situation both operationally and economically Although the situation may have changed by the time this article is published when the webinar was held China was only reporting a few new cases of Covid19 daily and was beginning to loosen restrictions on schools work and travel Domestic flights in China had returned to over 80 of previrus level while talks were underway to restart international passenger flights The Chinese government has provided comprehensive financial support to Chinese airlines and business in general However the overall reduction in demand for air travel is expected to result in some consolidation of airlines Hainan Airlines and its subsidiaries being a prime candidate Scott also told delegates how the onset of Covid19 has had profound effects on the global aircraft manufacturing sector with OEMs having to cut back on both production and deliveries Aircraft deliveries have fallen by as much as 50 and it could be upto 10 years before they return to 2019 levels With most aircraft fleets grounded there has also been a corresponding drop in maintenance repair and overhaul MRO activities as well as a knockon effect on the components supply chain sector Overcapacity and excess workforces are now a global issue yet China has not suffered as badly as some countries This fall in demand has had a bigger effect on overseas manufacturers which supply to China than within China itself “China will be impacted less due to its reduced reliance on Airbus Boeing and the engine companies” said Scott “China does not form the same level of their respective supply chains compared to other regions of the world” The situation is not the same for the OEMs supplying to China as 25 of Airbus and Boeing’s orders are going to Chinese airlines As China is the first country to emerge from Covid19 and resume domestic and international travel this means that while the total number of future deliveries for Airbus and Boeing will be less the percentage going to China will be higher possibly rising to 35 Government plans and investment COMACs Designing Research and Development Centre at Shanghai  COMACYouTube Scott explained how the Chinese aerospace and aviation market does not follow quite the same commercial rules as in other countries “China is aiming at a longterm strategy rather than immediate commercial advantages “ he explained “China has made no secret about its intentions which are to reduce its dependency upon overseas companies especially from the USA the term the ‘Trump factor’ is often used here The Chinese government has made large investments into a wide range of commercial military and space programmes including extensive aviation infrastructure – one example being the new fifth runway at Shanghai created especially for COMAC COMAC has multiple production lines three flight test centres and the engineering centre at COMAC is a huge campus The US and Europe can only dream of such commitment” Scott predicted that the Chinese aviation market will become even more significant in the shortmedium term China’s current aircraft projects are seen as stepping stones towards the longterm goal of selfsufficiency and are not based on commercial principles “China remains a low cost high quality solution” stated Scott “However salaries and overheads are increasing in metropolis areas and there has even been some manufacturing transitioning from China to lower cost Asian countries such as Vietnam” Aerospace projects A total of 25 ARJ21 regional jets are now in operation in China  Shimin Gu Scott outlined China’s current civil aviation projects which includes five different civil aircraft designs AG600 – The worlds’ largest amphibious aircraft designed to undertake firefighting and sea rescue roles Completely engineered and produced in China powered by four locally produced turboprop engines and able to accommodate 50 passengers MA60 – 80seat turboprop aircraft The first airframe has moved into structural test with the second aircraft due to be rolled out later this year The aircraft structure is locally produced with all systems supplied by overseas companies via local joint ventures JVs ARJ21 – 8090seat regional jet with 25 aircraft now in domestic operation The ARJ21 follows a similar local structureoverseas systems model C919 – 158190seat civil aircraft Not yet certificated six prototype aircraft are now flying from 3 different flight test centres Again the local structureoverseas systems model is being used CR929 – China also has a joint venture with UAC in Russia to develop a larger family of widebody aircraft accommodating 250280310 passengers Russia will produce the wings COMAC will produce the fuselage and undertake final assembly Due to its composite airframe COMACUAC have invited overseas companies with past composite airframe experience to participate on the CR929 via local JVs The CR929 systems will again be supplied using overseas suppliers within local JVs Engine selection is ongoing Work on the C929 has also been delayed by the Covid19 shutdown while the ongoing travel restrictions are making it difficult for the Russian and Chinese teams to travel and colocate Other aircraft  AVIC is also working on the development of a range of Chinesebuilt helicopters through joint ventures with helicopter OEMs “The helicopters are mostly based on older OEM designs to protect their latest intellectual property However new military helicopters designs are being developed in cooperation with Russia” EHang’s urban air mobility eVTOL manned flight test EHang eVTOL and unmanned aircraft  One new technology area where China is leading the field is in the development of eVTOL urban air mobility vehicles where Chinese manufacturer EHang has already delivered 34 vehicles to different cities around the world and recently gained approval for commercial operations in China Meanwhile full size twin turboprop aircraft from the Antonov era are being converted to remotelypiloted vehicles RPVs for China Post overnight and offshore deliveries There are also a large number of ongoing commercial drone delivery projects Engines  One area where China has not progressed as quickly as it hoped has been in aeroengines It was thought 25 years ago that China would now be selfsufficient in engines but now some experts think it may take another 25 years China is currently using western engines to power ARJ21 and the C919 but the Aero Engine Corporation of China AECC is well advanced in the development of commercial engine alternatives to the CFM LEAP engine for single aisle aircraft and the Rolls Royce or GE engine to be used on the CR929 A family of turboshaft engines is also being developed with Safran as a JV Prospects for Chinese aircraft China is encouraging Chinese carriers to buy Chinesemade aircraft China is not only working on the supply side of aircraft manufacturing but on the demand side too Professor Scott explained how the Chinese government is ‘encouraging’ Chinese carriers to buy its own aircraft in favour of those from overseas manufacturers “There will be substantial domestic deliveries” he said “Remember that the government owns the banks and the airlines A new startupsubsidiary airline was launched recently which will only use ARJ21 and C919 aircraft” He added that although the demand for new aircraft has fallen due to Covid19 this is not expected to impact the C929 project as it is a politicallydriven project with government funding and does not follow a traditional business model However there are still major challenges ahead if China is to compete with the major established OEMS such as Airbus and Boeing for international aircraft orders “COMAC does not have the advantage of benefitting from expertise learned with military projects as Boeing does” he commented “COMAC also only has a workforce one tenth the size of that of Airbus or Boeing The ARJ21 will undergo improvements while the C919 has still to certificated and the CR929 activity is ramping up When it comes to aircraft certification China is working towards having the Civil Aviation Administration of China CAAC approved as a certification authority by EASA thereby simplifying the COMAC and AVIC aircraft certification process Green aviation AECC aero engine design details AECC One topic which may affect the prospects of international aircraft sales that of environmental challenges and reductions in carbon emissions According to Professor Scott COMAC is working on synthetic fuel studies and has flown blended wing and strutwing scale models “There are certainly studies and ongoing initiatives but COMAC has its hands full on ARJ21 C919 and CR929 activities” says Scott “In reality the main environmental gains will come from the propulsion systems and AECC is certainly considering future regulation requirements in its engine developments” Opportunities for foreign investment Safran operates an engine parts manufacturing plant at Safran Aircraft Engines Suzhou which machines and assembles of lowpressure modules and parts for the CFM56 and LEAP engines  Safran With the rapid development of China’s aerospace industry and one of the few countries that is currently developing new civil aircraft there are potential business opportunities for overseas companies Scott outlined the various industry sectors in China in which western companies could become involved Manufactureassembly  State owned airlines commercial aircraft and aeroengine projects require local manufactureassembly with JVs preferred Also Airbus and Boeing need to place more supply chain value in China to meet industrial offset requirements Airframes systems and engines  There are supply opportunities in airframes systems and engines COMAC CR929 supplier selections are ongoing but significant delays and operational difficulties are to be expected With AECC there are also opportunities in turbomachinery engine nacelle structures and systems but intellectual property IP transfer is a challenge Chinesemade AC311 helicopter Peoplecn Helicopters  There is also a range of AVIC helicopter programmes with many airframe JVs Safran has an engine JV with AECC However the maturity level of these projects does mean that supply opportunities are now limited New programme s  For new commercial aircraft projects the COMACUAC CR929 aircraft project electrichybrid aircraft and the AECC commercial engine programmes offer the best shortterm supply opportunities Military and space  While there are a wide range of ongoing Chinese military and space programmes western companies are not eligible to compete Aircraft interiors Airbus China final assembly line at Tianjin  Airbus One specific sector highlighted by Professor Scott as offering real opportunities for western companies in China is that of aircraft interiors He explained how in 2019 the global interiors market was valued at 19bn and preCovid19 was expected to rise to 198bn in 2020 Widebody aircraft interiors typically cost four times as much to fit out as narrowbody interiors 5m vs 20m per aircraft which as there are more narrowbodies in service means that the market value for each type of aircraft is roughly similar and divided equally between line fit and retrofit deliveries Airbus has a final assembly line in China to complete A320s A330s and A350s while Boeing has a 737 MAX completions facility a JV with COMAC near Shanghai This work includes interior installation painting and customer delivery to Chinese and Asian operators Aircraft interiors are seen as a low intellectual property IP risk by Airbus and Boeing and local capability is also being actively supported by COMAC for its aircraft programmes “In China aircraft interiors offer significant opportunities for Airbus and Boeing aircraft completion as well as existing aircraft cabin retrofitupgrades” said Scott “As aviation adjusts to the new realities of flying in the Covid19 era despite the financial pressures on airlines there will be a drive towards more hygienic and selfsanitising aircraft interiors providing cabin retrofit business opportunities” Economic development zones Map of China’s Economic Development Zones  Alan MackWikipedia “If you want to enter the China market then you need to appreciate the central government view that aerospace is a central pillar of the country’s economic development” explained Scott “There are substantial funding and other practical benefits available for the creation and operation of new China based activities based on tax revenues and IP creation The Chinese government has created three primary development zones Beijing Shanghai and The Great Bay areaxa0 All regions within China compete to attract overseas entities so if you want to do business with China you need to sit down and work with the regions to develop tailor made solutions to gain the maximum benefits It is almost impossible to undertake this activity remotely Local participation and expertise is essential Given the current global political situation and Brexit how easy is collaboration between UK and Chinese aerospace companies “Provided that the UK avoid taking radical political stances and resists US influence the UK has improvedexcellent possibilities in China” states Scott “Of course most of the Tier 1 businesses in the UK are owned by overseas companies mainly the US and France which will limit these initiatives With the overcapacity situation caused by COVID19 you would expect any rationalisation of businesses and China initiatives to be directed to protect home resources over UK subsidiaries” However he added that COMAC cannot cope with Tier 2 interfacing “For traditional Tier 2 businesses a subtier collaboration consortium or joint venture approach is required” he said “However the commercial engine company AECC is more open to Tier 2 relationships because they are looking to access their specialist expertise Also collaboration with businesses already established in China is highly recommended in order to enable early market entry reduce the business risk and take advantage of their hard won local experience” JVs and WOFEs COMAC’s stated main role is the implementation of large passenger aircraft programmes in China  Professor Scott explained how there are two ways to do business in China through joint ventures JVs or through wholly owned foreign enterprises WOFEs Of these WOFEs rather than JVs offers the best business model if politically accepted China’s rail and shipbuilding industries started as JVs but China is now a global leader in these fields Tesla in China operates as a WOFE yet still received huge subsidies and support for its Gigafactory in Shanghai Substantial support ‘policies’ are available to new entrants the rules regarding share ownership are being relaxed and the list of forbidden activities reduced The company registration process is complicated however Scott said that he has personal experience of the registration process and could reassure prospective businesses not to fear business registration as local assistance is available However Scott added that for stateowned enterprise SOE projects politics does play a major part in selecting a Chinese business partner “If you wish to participate on the C929 COMAC will make suggestions as to whom you partner with” he said “You will need to try to create a viable business framework with them However the ARJ21 and C919 activities have shown that these forced marriages have proved difficult for both parties My advice is to sincerely attempt to make the proposed marriage work but also undertake your own assessment as to who is the most suitable local partner and don’t feel obligated COMAC is flexible and if you put a sound proposal on the table they will consider that” Working with SOEs Selections for CR929 suppliers are in progress Scott also added a word of warning for companies working with Chinese SOEs  such as COMAC AVIC and AECC “SOEs are struggling to adopt industry best practice tools and methods due to the SOE operational mindset” he explained “Complex aircraft and aerospace product development requires a collaborative concurrent working process However within SOEs people are still using the traditional SOE working practices where the aim is to please your boss to do work the work heshe wants and in risk avoidance for any potential personal blame Hence it has proved difficult to eliminate silo working and selfinterest The top COMAC leadership accepts and supports the need for change and we understand each other well but instilling change is like turning the rudder on a supertanker Cultural adaptation is certainly required but this operational transition is proving a challenge with little progress being made” He added “When dealing with SOEs it is essential to understand that when workingcooperatingsupplying to SOEs it is operationally very difficult and a financialbusiness case challenge Local knowledge political connections and building robust relationships are essential although the use of local agents is rarely successful and simply adds cost Your business case operating budgets and schedules need to compensate for the working inefficiencies decision delays a lack of openness and low project visibility when working with SOEs as opposed to cooperating with privatelyowned enterprises POEs Working with POEs Scott then went on to explain how POEs in China operate very differently and usually fall into two categories The first type are familyowned businesses that generally operate using a ‘market stall’ mentality they are agile vertically integrated grow organically but use limited management resources centralised decision making and a simple business strategy The second type of POE has adopted western corporate practices with its leadership usually having been educated and possibly having also worked overseas before returning to take full advantage of the business environment in China Both types of POEs can be very successful and formidable businesses However both types of POE are tough business people Importance of good relationships Second C919 prototype test flight Ken ChanWikipedia Hence explained Scott the approach needed for SOE and POE cooperation is very different Every potential partner will need to be considered individually with the essential special relationship ‘Guanxi’ developed using local expertise ‘Guanxi’ – is defined as having personal trust in a relationship “Companies wanting to do business with SOEs need to invest time and resources to establish local relationships and Guanxi” said Scott “It’s not about being the cheapest solution knowledge of the local operational landscape is essential and firsthand experience is needed” For example if you are in negotiations where the Chinese decision makers do not speak English and you do not speak Mandarin you are in a highrisk situation and are likely to suffer extensive iterations in discussions negotiations deliverable definitions schedule definition contracts and payment structures” This wastes huge amounts of time and requires multiple meetingsvisits Local agents rarely prove successful You need someone with actual operational experience to support you plus interpretation that you can trust Many translation services will only translate what they think you want to hear or what they think you should be saying rather than what you actually mean to avoid insulting the Chinese side This simply introduces confusion and misunderstanding especially when the same is happening via translation from the customer Also the Chinese rarely say what they actually mean especially if they wish to stall or delay proceedings You must also have the applicable stake holdersdecision makers present or you will simply have to repeat the process again and again “The best approach is to collaborate with companies which have a wellestablished presence in China and engage with people such as myself who have gained real world operational experience in China rather than agents” IPR Another issue is that of intellectual property rights IPR “IP protection is important and needs to be managed appropriately” admitted Scott “China is introducing fasttrack patent registration and protection measures including infringement courts IP rights is a risk but can be managed – GE and other major players in China have managed IP successfully for more than 45 years You need to be open and honest and not promise IP transfer if there is no intention to do so Joint ventures vary – some companies don’t share IP but want cheap manufacturing Other companies have genuine JVs such as the example of AVIAGE avionics Honeywell has a team in China working mostly on non COMAC activities but are able to switch their resources on to COMAC as required One significant advantage of creating a WOFE over a JV is that if you don’t have Chinese partner you don’t have an IPR problem to manage” To the future China’s aerospace industry is fast becoming more of an international presence Looking to China’s role in the future Scott concluded by saying “I have never known a time when the global aerospace industry was so lacking in major commercial aircraft development programmes The current downturn in new aircraft orders and orderbook deferrals for existing aircraft orders means that both the OEMs and their supply chain cannot afford completely new aircraft programmes in the foreseeable future In my view the most likely new development from Airbus and Boeing will be the launch of reengined versions of the A350 NEO and the 787 MAX using RollsRoyce Ultrafan and GE Next Gen engines ie very limited developmentnew supply opportunities This means that apart from a few exceptions such as the Dassault Falcon 10X business aircraft the only new commercial projects ongoing are electrichybrid projects and the Chinese CR929 aircraft and commercial engine programmes Hence the China market will become even more important going forward The recent pledge by the French government to provide significant support for their aerospace industry will hopefully be matched by other European governments and the UK The current dire situation in the industry caused by Covid19 has actually created a unique opportunity to accelerate the introduction of more environmentally acceptable green aircraft Funding is needed to support the development of electric hybrid and hydrogenbased propulsion systems housed within lightweight low cost airframes optimised for vertical and regional missions as a first phase Without such initiatives Europe the UK and the USA will allow China to catch up and move closer to their end objective of selfsufficiency” Bill Read 26 June 2020 Air Transport Engineering  Design Flight Test Propulsion Rotorcraft Coronavirus UAS News  Features Industry
